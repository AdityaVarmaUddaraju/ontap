[.lead]
The root replacement procedure migrates the current root aggregate to another set of disks without disruption.

.About this task

Storage failover must be enabled to relocate root volumes. You can use the `storage failover modify -node _nodename_ -enable true` command to enable failover.

You can change the location of the root volume to a new aggregate in the following scenarios:

* When the root aggregates are not on the disk you prefer
* When you want to rearrange the disks connected to the node
* When you are performing a shelf replacement of the EOS disk shelves

.Steps

. Set the privilege level to advanced:
+
`*set privilege advanced*`
. Relocate the root aggregate:
+
`*system node migrate-root -node _nodename_ -disklist _disklist_ -raid-type _raid-type_*`
 ** *-node*
+
Specifies the node that owns the root aggregate that you want to migrate.

 ** *-disklist*
+
Specifies the list of disks on which the new root aggregate will be created. All disks must be spares and owned by the same node. The minimum number of disks required is dependent on the RAID type.

 ** *-raid-type*
+
Specifies the RAID type of the root aggregate. The default value is `raid-dp`.
. Monitor the progress of the job:
+
`*job show -id _jobid_ -instance*`

.Results

If all of the pre-checks are successful, the command starts a root volume replacement job and exits. Expect the node to restart.
