ONTAP manual (man) pages explain how to use ONTAP commands. They are available at the command line and on the NetApp Support Site.

The `man` `_command_name_` command displays the man page of the specified command. If you do not specify a command name, the man page index is displayed. You can use the `man man` command to view information about the `man` command itself. You can exit a man page by entering `*q*`.

The _Commands: Manual Page Reference_ is a compilation of man pages for the admin-level and advanced-level ONTAP commands. It is available on the http://mysupport.netapp.com/[NetApp Support Site].
