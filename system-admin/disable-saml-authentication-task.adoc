You can disable SAML authentication when you want to stop authenticating web users by using an external Identity Provider (IdP). When SAML authentication is disabled, the configured directory service providers such as Active Directory and LDAP are used for authentication.

.What you'll need

You must be logged in from the console.

.Steps

. Disable SAML authentication:
+
`*security saml-sp modify -is-enabled false*`
. If you no longer want to use SAML authentication or if you want to modify the IdP, delete the SAML configuration:
+
`*security saml-sp delete*`
