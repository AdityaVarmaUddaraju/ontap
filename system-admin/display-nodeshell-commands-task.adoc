[.lead]
You can obtain a list of available nodeshell commands by using the CLI help from the nodeshell.

.Steps

. To access the nodeshell, enter the following command at the clustershell's system prompt:
+
`*system node run -node {nodename|local}*`
+
`local` is the node you used to access the cluster.
+
[NOTE]
====
The `system node run` command has an alias command, `run`.
====

. Enter the following command in the nodeshell to see the list of available nodeshell commands:
+
`*[commandname] help*`
+
`commandname` is the name of the command whose availability you want to display. If you do not include `commandname`, the CLI displays all available nodeshell commands.
+
You enter `exit` or type Ctrl-d to return to the clustershell CLI.

.Example of displaying available nodeshell commands

The following example accesses the nodeshell of a node named node2 and displays information for the nodeshell command `environment`:

----
cluster1::> system node run -node node2
Type 'exit' or 'Ctrl-D' to return to the CLI

node2> environment help
Usage: environment status |
     [status] [shelf [<adapter>[.<shelf-number>]]] |
     [status] [shelf_log] |
     [status] [shelf_stats] |
     [status] [shelf_power_status] |
     [status] [chassis [all | list-sensors | Temperature | PSU 1 |
     PSU 2 | Voltage | SYS FAN | NVRAM6-temperature-3 | NVRAM6-battery-3]]
