You can reboot a node in normal mode from the system prompt. A node is configured to boot from the boot device, such as a PC CompactFlash card.

.Steps

. If the cluster contains four or more nodes, verify that the node to be rebooted does not hold epsilon:
.. Set the privilege level to advanced:
+
`*set -privilege advanced*`
.. Determine which node holds epsilon:
+
`*cluster show*`
+
The following example shows that "`node1`" holds epsilon:
+
----
cluster1::*> cluster show
Node                 Health  Eligibility   Epsilon
-------------------- ------- ------------  ------------
node1                true    true          true
node2                true    true          false
node3                true    true          false
node4                true    true          false
4 entries were displayed.

.. If the node to be rebooted holds epsilon, then remove epsilon from the node:
+
`*cluster modify -node _node_name_ -epsilon false*`
.. Assign epsilon to a different node that will remain up:
+
`*cluster modify -node _node_name_ -epsilon true*`
.. Return to the admin privilege level:
+
`*set -privilege admin*`
. Use the `system node reboot` command to reboot the node.
+
If you do not specify the `-skip-lif-migration` parameter, the command attempts to migrate data and cluster management LIFs synchronously to another node prior to the reboot. If the LIF migration fails or times out, the rebooting process is aborted, and ONTAP displays an error to indicate the LIF migration failure.
+
----
cluster1::> system node reboot -node node1 -reason "software upgrade"
----
+
The node begins the reboot process. The ONTAP login prompt appears, indicating that the reboot process is complete.
