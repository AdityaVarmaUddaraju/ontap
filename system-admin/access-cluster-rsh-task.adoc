[.lead]
You can issue RSH requests to the cluster to perform administrative tasks. RSH is not a secure protocol and is disabled by default.

.What you'll need

The following conditions must be met before you can use RSH to access the cluster:

* You must have a cluster local user account that is configured to use RSH as an access method.
+
The `-application` parameter of the `security login` commands specifies the access method for a user account. For more information, see the `security login` man pages.

* RSH must already be enabled in the management firewall policy that is used by the cluster or node management LIFs so that RSH requests can go through the firewall.
+
By default, RSH is disabled. The `system services firewall policy show` command with the `-service rsh` parameter displays whether RSH has been enabled in a firewall policy. For more information, see the `system services firewall policy` man pages.

* If you use IPv6 connections, IPv6 must already be configured and enabled on the cluster, and firewall policies must already be configured with IPv6 addresses.
+
The `network options ipv6 show` command displays whether IPv6 is enabled. The `system services firewall policy show` command displays firewall policies.

.About this task

* RSH is not a secure protocol.
+
You should consider using SSH to access the cluster. SSH provides a secure remote shell and interactive network session.

* ONTAP supports a maximum of 50 concurrent RSH sessions per node.
+
If the cluster management LIF resides on the node, it shares this limit with the node management LIF.
+
If the rate of in-coming connections is higher than 10 per second, the service is temporarily disabled for 60 seconds.

.Steps

. From an administration host, enter the following command:
+
`*rsh _hostname_or_IP_ -l _username:passwordcommand_*`
+
`hostname_or_IP` is the host name or the IP address of the cluster management LIF or a node management LIF. Using the cluster management LIF is recommended. You can use an IPv4 or IPv6 address.
+
`command` is the command you want to execute over RSH.

.Example of an RSH request

The following example shows how the user named "`joe`", who has been set up with RSH access, can issue an RSH request to run the `cluster show` command:

----

admin_host$ rsh 10.72.137.28 -l joe:password cluster show

Node                  Health  Eligibility
--------------------- ------- ------------
node1                 true    true
node2                 true    true
2 entries were displayed.
