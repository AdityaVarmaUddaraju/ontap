The SSL protocol improves the security of web access by using a digital certificate to establish an encrypted connection between a web server and a browser.

You can manage SSL for the cluster or a storage virtual machine (SVM) in the following ways:

* Enabling SSL
* Generating and installing a digital certificate and associating it with the cluster or SVM
* Displaying the SSL configuration to see whether SSL has been enabled, and, if available, the SSL certificate name
* Setting up firewall policies for the cluster or SVM, so that web access requests can go through
* Defining which SSL versions can be used
* Restricting access to only HTTPS requests for a web service
