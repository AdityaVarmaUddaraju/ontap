There are three categories of jobs that you can manage: server-affiliated, cluster-affiliated, and private.

A job can be in any of the following categories:

* *Server-Affiliated jobs*
+
These jobs are queued by the management framework to a specific node to be run.

* *Cluster-Affiliated jobs*
+
These jobs are queued by the management framework to any node in the cluster to be run.

* *Private jobs*
+
These jobs are specific to a node and do not use the replicated database (RDB) or any other cluster mechanism. The commands that manage private jobs require the advanced privilege level or higher.
