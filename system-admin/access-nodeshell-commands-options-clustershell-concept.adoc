Nodeshell commands and options are accessible through the nodeshell (`system node run –node _nodename_`). Many commonly used nodeshell commands and options are tunneled or aliased into the clustershell and can be executed also from the clustershell.

Nodeshell options that are supported in the clustershell can be accessed by using the `vserver options clustershel` command. To see these options, you can do one of the following:

* Query the clustershell CLI with `vserver options -vserver _nodename_or_clustername_ -option-name`?`
* Access the `vserver options` man page in the clustershell CLI with `man vserver options`

If you enter a nodeshell or legacy command or option in the clustershell, and the command or option has an equivalent clustershell command, ONTAP informs you of the clustershell command to use.

If you enter a nodeshell or legacy command or option that is not supported in the clustershell, ONTAP informs you of the "`not supported`" status for the command or option.
