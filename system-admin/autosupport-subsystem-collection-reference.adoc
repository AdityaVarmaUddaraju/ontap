Each subsystem provides basic and troubleshooting information that AutoSupport uses for its messages. Each subsystem is also associated with trigger events that allow AutoSupport to collect from subsystems only information that is relevant to the trigger event.

AutoSupport collects context-sensitive content. You can view information about subsystems and trigger events by using the `system node autosupport trigger show` command.
