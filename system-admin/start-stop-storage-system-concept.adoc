You might need to start or stop a node for maintenance or troubleshooting reasons. You can do so from the ONTAP CLI, the boot environment prompt, or the SP CLI.

Using the SP CLI command `system power off` or `system power cycle` to turn off or power-cycle a node might cause an improper shutdown of the node (also called a _dirty shutdown_) and is not a substitute for a graceful shutdown using the ONTAP `system node halt` command.
