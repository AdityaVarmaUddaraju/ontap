If configuring Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication fails, you can manually repair each node on which the SAML configuration failed and recover from the failure. During the repair process, the web server is restarted and any active HTTP connections or HTTPS connections are disrupted.

.About this task

When you configure SAML authentication, ONTAP applies SAML configuration on a per-node basis. When you enable SAML authentication, ONTAP automatically tries to repair each node if there are configuration issues. If there are issues with SAML configuration on any node, you can disable SAML authentication and then reenable SAML authentication. There can be situations when SAML configuration fails to apply on one or more nodes even after you reenable SAML authentication. You can identify the node on which SAML configuration has failed and then manually repair that node.

.Steps

. Log in to the advanced privilege level:
+
`*set -privilege advanced*`
. Identify the node on which SAML configuration failed:
+
`*security saml-sp status show -instance*`
+
----
cluster_12::*> security saml-sp status show -instance

. Repair the SAML configuration on the failed node:
+
`*security saml-sp repair -node _node_name_*`
+
----
cluster_12::*> security saml-sp repair -node node2

. Verify that SAML is successfully configured on all of the nodes:

`*security saml-sp status show -instance*`
