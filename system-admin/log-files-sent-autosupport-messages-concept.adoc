AutoSupport messages can contain several key log files that enable technical support staff to review recent system activity.

All types of AutoSupport messages might include the following log files when the Log Files subsystem is enabled:

[options="header"]
|===
| Log file| Amount of data included from the file
a|

* Log files from the `/mroot/etc/log/mlog/` directory
* The MESSAGES log file

a|
Only new lines added to the logs since the last AutoSupport message up to a specified maximum. This ensures that AutoSupport messages have unique, relevant--not overlapping--data.

(Log files from partners are the exception; for partners, the maximum allowed data is included.)

a|

* Log files from the `/mroot/etc/log/shelflog/` directory
* Log files from the `/mroot/etc/log/acp/` directory
* Event Management System (EMS) log data

a|
The most recent lines of data up to a specified maximum.

The content of AutoSupport messages can change between releases of ONTAP.
