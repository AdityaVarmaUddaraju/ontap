You can delete an unneeded static route from a storage virtual machine (SVM).

*Step*

Use the `network route delete` command to delete a static route.

For more information about this command, see the network route man page.

The following example deletes a static route associated with SVM vs0 with a gateway of 10.63.0.1 and a destination IP address of 0.0.0.0/0:

....
network route delete -vserver vs0 -gateway 10.63.0.1 -destination 0.0.0.0/0
....
