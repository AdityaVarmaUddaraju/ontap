A LIF represents a network access point to a node in the cluster. You can configure LIFs on ports over which the cluster sends and receives communications over the network.

A cluster administrator can create, view, modify, migrate, or delete LIFs. An SVM administrator can only view the LIFs associated with the SVM.
