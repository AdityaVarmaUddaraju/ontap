This guide describes cluster networking best practices for ONTAP 9.8 and later releases.

This guide covers a wide array of network management topics, including how to configure and manage physical and virtual network ports (VLANs and interface groups), LIFs using IPv4 and IPv6, routing, and host-resolution services in clusters; optimize network traffic by load balancing; and monitor the cluster by using SNMP.
