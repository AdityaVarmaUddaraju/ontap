If you no longer need a subnet and want to deallocate the IP addresses that were assigned to the subnet, you can delete it.

*About this task*

You will receive an error if any service processor or network interfaces are currently using IP addresses in the specified ranges. If you want the interfaces to continue to use the IP addresses even after the subnet is deleted, you can set the -force-update-lif-associations option to true to remove the subnet's association with the LIFs.

*Step*

Delete a subnet:

....
network subnet delete -subnet-name subnet_name [-ipspace ipspace_name] [-force-update-lif- associations true]
....

The following command deletes subnet sub1 in IPspace ipspace1:

....
network subnet delete -subnet-name sub1 -ipspace ipspace1
....
