[.lead]
You can move a LUN to another volume within the storage VM to balance the load, or you can move it to a volume with a higher performance service level to improve performance.

== Move restrictions

* A LUN cannot be moved to a qtree with the same volume.
* A LUN created from a file using the CLI cannot be moved with System Manager.
* LUNs that are online and serving data cannot be moved.
* LUNs cannot be moved if the allocated space in the destination volume cannot contain the LUN (even if autogrow is enabled on the volume).
* LUNs on SnapLock volumes cannot be moved with System Manager.
