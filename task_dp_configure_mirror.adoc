Create a mirror and vault of a volume for disaster recovery of the latest data and to have multiple archived versions of data to which you can roll back. Only combined mirror and vault is supported. You cannot specify separate mirror and vault policies.

This procedure creates a mirror and vault on a remote cluster. The source cluster and destination cluster use intercluster LIFs for exchanging data. The procedure assumes the link:task_dp_prepare_mirror.html[intercluster LIFs are created and the clusters and the storage VMs containing the volumes are peered] (paired).
