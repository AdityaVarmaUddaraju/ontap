[.lead]
Create a mirror and vault of a volume for disaster recovery of the latest data and to have multiple archived versions of data to which you can roll back. Only combined mirror and vault is supported. You cannot specify separate mirror and vault policies.

This procedure creates a mirror and vault on a remote cluster. The source cluster and destination cluster use intercluster LIFs for exchanging data. The procedure assumes the link:task_dp_prepare_mirror.html[intercluster LIFs are created and the clusters containing the volumes are peered] (paired). You can also peer SVMs for data protection; however, if SVMs are not peered, but permissions are enabled, SVMs are automatically peered when the protection relationship is created.

.Steps

. Select the volume or LUN to protect: click *Storage > Volumes* or *Storage > LUNs*, and then click the desired volume or LUN name.

. Click image:icon_protect.gif[alt=Protect button].

. Select the destination cluster and storage VM.

. The asynchronous policy is selected by default. To select a synchronous policy, click *More Options*.

. Click *Protect*.

. Click the *SnapMirror (Local or Remote)* tab for the selected volume or LUN to verify that protection is set up correctly.
