Edit the storage VM to add a policy that controls user and group access permissions to multiple buckets.

You can add a group policy to manage access to all buckets in an S3-enabled storage VM, rather than managing access permissions for individual buckets. Doing so simplifies management when buckets are added or when access needs change.

You must have already created users and at least one group before granting permissions in a policy.

.Steps
.	Edit the storage VM: click *Storage > storage VMs*, click the storage VM, click *Settings* and then click image:icon_pencil.gif[pencil icon] under S3.
.	Add a user: click *Policies*, then click *Add*.
..	Enter a policy name and select from a list of groups.
..	You can select an existing default policy or add a new one.
When adding or modifying a group policy, you can specify the following parameters:

*	Group: the groups to whom access is granted.
*	Effect: allows or denies access to a group.
*	Actions: permissible actions in the bucket for a given group.
*	Resources: paths and names of objects within the bucket for which access is granted or denied.
The defaults *_bucketname_* and *_bucketname/*_* grant access to all objects in the bucket. You can also grant access to single objects; for example, *_bucketname/_*_readme.txt*.

..	You can add statements to existing policies.
