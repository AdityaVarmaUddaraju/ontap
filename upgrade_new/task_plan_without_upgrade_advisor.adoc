It is a best practice to use Upgrade Advisor in link:https://aiq.netapp.com/[Active IQ] to plan your upgrade. If you do not have an active link:https://www.netapp.com/us/services/support-edge.aspx[SupportEdge] contract for Active IQ, you should perform the necessary pre-upgrade checks and create your own upgrade plan.
