If you are not using Upgrade Advisor, you must determine what version of ONTAP you can upgrade to and manually estimate how long your upgrade will take.

== What version of ONTAP can I upgrade to?

The version of ONTAP that you can upgrade to varies based on the version of ONTAP currently running on your nodes. You can determine the current version of ONTAP running on each node by using the `system image show` command.

| You can upgrade from...| To...
a|
ONTAP 9.7
a|
ONTAP 9.8
a|
ONTAP 9.6
a|
ONTAP 9.7 or 9.8
a|
ONTAP 9.5

ONTAP 9.6 or 9.7
a|
ONTAP 9.4

ONTAP 9.5
a|
ONTAP 9.3

ONTAP 9.4, 9.5 or 9.7**Note:** If you are upgrading from ONTAP 9.3 directly to 9.7, you must download the software image for ONTAP 9.5 and 9.7. The automated upgrade process uses the 9.5 image in the background to complete the update to 9.7. You should expect multiple reboots during the process.

ONTAP 9.2
a|
ONTAP 9.3
a|
ONTAP 9.1
a|
ONTAP 9.2 or 9.3
a|
ONTAP 9
a|
ONTAP 9.1
a|
Data ONTAP 8.3.x
a|
ONTAP 9 or 9.1
a|
Data ONTAP 8.2.x or earlier

NOTE: If you are running a release earlier than Data ONTAP 8.3.x, you cannot upgrade directly to ONTAP 9 or 9.1. You must upgrade to Data ONTAP 8.3.x first, then upgrade to ONTAP 9 or 9.1.

Data ONTAP 8.3.x

== How long will my upgrade take?

You should plan for at least 30 minutes to complete preparatory steps, 60 minutes to upgrade each HA pair, and at least 30 minutes to complete post-upgrade steps.

The upgrade duration guidelines are based on typical configurations and workloads. You can use these guidelines to estimate the time it will take to perform a nondisruptive upgrade in your environment. However, the actual duration of your upgrade process will depend on your individual environment and the number of nodes.
