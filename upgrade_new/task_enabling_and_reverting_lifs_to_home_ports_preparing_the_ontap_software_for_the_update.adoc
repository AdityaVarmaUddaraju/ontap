During a reboot, some LIFs might have been migrated to their assigned failover ports. Before and after you upgrade a cluster, you must enable and revert any LIFs that are not on their home ports.

The network interface revert command reverts a LIF that is not currently on its home port back to its home port, provided that the home port is operational. A LIF's home port is specified when the LIF is created; you can determine the home port for a LIF by using the network interface show command.

. Display the status of all LIFs: `network interface show`
+
This example displays the status of all LIFs for a storage virtual machine (SVM).

If any LIFs appear with a Status Admin status of down or with an Is home status of false, continue with the next step.

. Enable the data LIFs: `network interface modify {-role data} -status-admin up`
+
----
cluster1::> network interface modify {-role data} -status-admin up
8 entries were modified.

. Revert LIFs to their home ports: `network interface revert *`
+
This command reverts all LIFs back to their home ports.
+
----
cluster1::> network interface revert *
8 entries were acted on.

. Verify that all LIFs are in their home ports: `network interface show`
+
This example shows that all LIFs for SVM vs0 are on their home ports.
