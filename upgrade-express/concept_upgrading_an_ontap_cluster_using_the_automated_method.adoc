The automated upgrade method validates the cluster components to verify that the cluster can be upgraded, installs the target ONTAP image on each node, and then executes the upgrade in the background. Automated upgrades of multi-node clusters are non-disruptive. Automated upgrades of single-node clusters are disruptive because single-node clusters lack redundancy.

Starting in ONTAP 9.8, the automated update method also generates an automated MAINT (Maintenance) Start message before the upgrade begins and an End AutoSupport message after the upgrade completes or is cancelled.
