You should plan for at least 30 minutes to complete preparatory steps, at least 30 minutes to upgrade the cluster (depending on the number of nodes), and at least 30 minutes to complete post-upgrade steps.

The upgrade duration guidelines are based on typical configurations and workloads. You can use these guidelines to estimate the time it will take to perform a nondisruptive upgrade in your environment. However, the actual duration of your upgrade process will depend on your individual environment and the number of nodes.
