This content describes how to quickly configure ONTAP 9 to send important EMS (Event Management System) event notifications directly to an email address, a syslog server, or a Simple Management Network Protocol (SNMP) traphost so that you are immediately notified of system issues that require prompt attention.

To monitor the most important activities in your system, you must monitor the important EMS events.

Because important event notifications are not enabled by default, you must configure the EMS to send notifications to either an email address, a syslog server, or an SNMP traphost.

Use this content to configure EMS event notifications for important events if the following are true:

* You are implementing one of the following scenarios:
 ** You are setting up a new system running ONTAP 9 that does not have EMS configured.
 ** You have an existing system running ONTAP 9 that does not have EMS configured.
 ** You are upgrading to ONTAP 9 that does not have EMS configured.
 ** You have just completed a transition from Data ONTAP operating in 7-Mode to ONTAP 9.
* You want to use best practices, not explore every available option.
* You do not want to read a lot of conceptual background.

If this content is not suitable for your situation, you should see the following documentation instead:
