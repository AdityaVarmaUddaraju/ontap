Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, you can protect buckets in ONTAP S3 object stores using familiar SnapMirror mirroring and backup functionality. In addition, unlike standard SnapMirror, S3 SnapMirror can have non-NetApp destinations.

S3 SnapMirror supports active mirrors and backup tiers from ONTAP S3 buckets to the following destinations:

[cols=3*,options="header",cols="50,25,25"]

| Target
| Supports active mirrors and takeover?
| Supports backup and restore?
a| ONTAP S3

* buckets in the same SVM
* buckets in different SVMs on the same cluster
* buckets in SVMs on different clusters

You can protect existing buckets on ONTAP S3 servers or you can create new buckets with data protection enabled immediately.

S3 SnapMirror supports fan-out and cascade relationships. For an overview, see link:../data-protection/supported-deployment-config-concept.html[Fan-out and cascade data protection deployments].

== S3 SnapMirror requirements

* ONTAP version
ONTAP 9.10.1 or later must be running source and destination clusters.
* Licensing
The following license bundles are required on ONTAP source and destination systems:
** Core Bundle
For ONTAP S3 protocol and storage.
** Data Protection Bundle
For S3 SnapMirror to target other NetApp object store targets (ONTAP S3, StorageGRID, and Cloud Volumes ONTAP).
** Data Protection Bundle and Hybrid Cloud Bundle
For S3 SnapMirror to target 3rd party object stores (AWS S3).
* 	ONTAP S3
** ONTAP S3 servers must be running source and destination SVMs.
** It is recommended but not required that certificates for TLS access are installed on the S3 servers. You can use system-generated certificates or certificates from an external authority.
* Peering (for ONTAP S3 targets)
** Intercluster LIFs must be configured (for remote ONTAP targets).
** Source and destination clusters are peered (for remote ONTAP targets).
** Source and destination storage VMs are peered (for all ONTAP targets).
* SnapMirror policy
An S3-specific SnapMirror policy is required for all S3 SnapMirror relationships, but you can use the same policy for multiple relationships.
* Root user keys
Storage VM root user access keys are required for S3 SnapMirror relationships; ONTAP does not assign them by default. The first time you create an S3 SnapMirror relationship, you must verify that the keys exist on source and destination storage VMs and regenerate them if they do not. Once assigned, they should not be regenerated or existing S3 SnapMirror relationships will fail.

* link:../s3-config/index.html[About the S3 configuration process (CLI)]

For information about cluster and storage VM peering, see the following topic:

* link:../task_dp_prepare_mirror.html[Prepare for mirroring and vaulting (System Manager, steps 1-6)]
* link:../peering/index.html[Cluster and SVM peering (CLI)]

== S3 SnapMirror considerations and restrictions

The following standard SnapMirror functionality is not supported in the current S3 SnapMirror release:

* Fan-in deployments (data protection relationships between multiple source buckets and a single destination bucket)
S3 Snapmirror can support multiple bucket mirrors from multiple clusters to a single secondary cluster, but each source bucket must have its own destination bucket on the secondary cluster.
