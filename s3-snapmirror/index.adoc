Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, you can protect buckets in ONTAP S3 object stores using familiar SnapMirror mirroring and backup functionality. In addition, unlike standard SnapMirror, S3 SnapMirror can have non-NetApp destinations.

S3 SnapMirror supports active mirrors and backup tiers from ONTAP S3 buckets to the following destinations:

[cols=3*,options="header",cols="50,25,25"]

| Target
| Supports active mirrors and takeover?
| Supports backup and restore?
a| ONTAP S3

* buckets in the same SVM
* buckets in different SVMs on the same cluster
* buckets in SVMs on different clusters

You can protect existing buckets on ONTAP S3 servers or you can create new buckets with data protection enabled immediately.

== S3 SnapMirror requirements

* ONTAP version
ONTAP 9.10.1 or later must be running source and destination clusters.
* Licensing
The following license bundles are required on ONTAP source and destination systems:
** Core Bundle
For ONTAP S3 protocol and storage.
** Data Protection Bundle
For S3 SnapMirror to target other NetApp object store targets (ONTAP S3, StorageGRID, and Cloud Volumes ONTAP).
** Data Protection Bundle and Hybrid Cloud Bundle
For S3 SnapMirror to target 3rd party object stores (AWS S3).
* 	ONTAP S3
ONTAP S3 servers with certificates installed for TLS access must be running source and destination SVMs.
* Peering (for ONTAP S3 targets)
** Intercluster LIFs must be configured (for remote ONTAP targets).
** Source and destination clusters are peered (for remote ONTAP targets).
** Source and destination storage VMs are peered (for all ONTAP targets).
* SnapMirror policy
An S3-specific SnapMirror policy is required for all S3 SnapMirror relationships, but you can use the same policy for multiple relationships.
* Root user keys
The first time you create an S3 SnapMirror relationship, you must generate root user keys on the source and destination storage VMs. Root user keys are required for S3 SnapMirror and ONTAP does not assign them by default. Once assigned, it is not necessary to regenerate them for additional S3 SnapMirror relationships.

For information about S3 server configuration, see the following topics:

* link:../task_object_provision_enable_s3_server.html[Enable an S3 server on a storage VM]
* link:../s3-config/index.html[About the S3 configuration process (CLI)]

For information about cluster and storage VM peering, see the following topic:

* link:../task_dp_prepare_mirror.html[Prepare for mirroring and vaulting (System Manager, steps 1-6)]
* link:../peering/index.html[Cluster and SVM peering (CLI)]

== S3 SnapMirror considerations and restrictions

The following standard SnapMirror functionality is not supported in the current S3 SnapMirror release:

* Fan-in deployments (data protection relationships between multiple primary systems and a single secondary system)
