When you create new S3 buckets, you can protect them immediately to an S3 SnapMirror destination on a remote cluster.

.What you’ll need

* Requirements for ONTAP versions, licensing, and S3 server configuration have been completed.
* A peering relationship exists between source and destination storage VMs.
* If you are mirroring data to a remote cluster, a peering relationship exists between source and destination clusters.
* CA Certificates for the S3 servers info will need to be entered in the source and destination VMs.

.About this task

You will need to perform tasks on both source and destination systems.

== System Manager procedure

. If this is the first S3 SnapMirror relationship for this storage VM, regenerate the root user keys in both the source and destination storage VMs:
.. Click *Storage > Storage VMs* and then select the storage VM.
.. In the *Settings* tab, click image:icon_pencil.gif[edit icon] in the *S3* tile.
.. In the *Users* tab, click image:icon_kabob.gif[more icon] next to *root*, then click *Regenerate Key*.
. Edit the storage VM to add users, and to add users to groups, in both the source and destination storage VMs:
+
Click *Storage > storage VMs*, click the storage VM, click *Settings* and then click image:icon_pencil.gif[edit icon] under S3.
+
See link:../task_object_provision_add_s3_users_groups.html[Add S3 users and groups] for more information.
+
. Create a bucket with SnapMirror protection:
.. Click *Storage > Buckets*, then click *Add*.
.. Enter a name, select the storage VM, enter a size, then click *More Options*.
.. Under *Permissions*, click *Add*. Make sure the following values are shown:
* *Principal: All users of this storage VM* (default)
* *Effect: Allow*(default)
* *Actions*:
`GetObject,PutObject,DeleteObject,ListBucket,GetBucketAcl,GetObjectAcl,ListBucketMultipartUploads,ListMultipartUploadParts`
* *Resources: bucketname, bucketname/*  (default)
+
See link:../task_object_provision_manage_bucket_access.html[Manage user access to buckets] for more information about these fields.
.. Under *Protection*, check *Enable SnapMirror (ONTAP or Cloud)*. Then enter the following values:
* Destination
** *TARGET: ONTAP System*
** *CLUSTER*: Select the remote cluster.
** *STORAGE VM*: Select a storage VM on the remote cluster.
** *S3 SERVER CA CERTIFICATE*: Copy and paste the contents of the _source_ certificate.
* Source
** *S3 SERVER CA CERTIFICATE:* Copy and paste the contents of the _destination_ certificate.

When you click *Save*, a new bucket is created in the source storage VM, and it is mirrored to the destination VM.

== CLI procedure

. If this is the first S3 SnapMirror relationship for this storage VM, regenerate the root user keys in both the source and destination SVMs:
`vserver object-store-server user regenerate-keys -vserver svm_name -user root`
. Create buckets in both the source and destination SVMs:
`vserver object-store-server bucket create -vserver svm_name -bucket bucket_name [-size integer[KB|MB|GB|TB|PB]] [-comment text] [additional_options]`
. Add access rules to the default bucket policies in both the source and destination SVMs:
`vserver object-store-server bucket policy add-statement -vserver svm_name -bucket bucket_name -effect {allow|deny} -action object_store_actions -principal user_and_group_names -resource object_store_resources [-sid text] [-index integer]`
+
.Example
`src_cluster::> vserver object-store-server bucket policy add-statement -bucket test-bucket -effect allow -action GetObject,PutObject,DeleteObject,ListBucket,GetBucketAcl,GetObjectAcl,ListBucketMultipartUploads,ListMultipartUploadParts -principal - -resource test-bucket, test-bucket /*`
+
. On the source SVM, create an S3 SnapMirror policy if you don’t have an existing one that addresses this use case:
`snapmirror policy create -vserver svm_name -policy policy_name -type continuous [-rpo integer] [-throttle throttle_type] [-comment text] [additional_options]`
+
Parameters:

* type `continuous` – the only policy type for S3 SnapMirror relationships (required).
* `-rpo` – specifies the time for recovery point objective, in seconds (optional).
* `-throttle` – specifies the upper limit on throughput/bandwidth, in kilobytes/seconds (optional).
+
.Example
`src_cluster::> snapmirror policy create -vserver vs0 -type continuous -rpo 0 -policy test-policy`
. On the source SVM, create an S3 SnapMirror relationship:
`snapmirror create -source-path cluster_name://svm_name/bucket/bucket_name -destination-path cluster_name://svm_name/bucket/bucket_name, ...} -policy policy_name`
+
.Example
`src_cluster::> snapmirror create -source-path src_cluster://vs0/bucket/test-bucket -destination-path dest_cluster://vs1/bucket/test-bucket-mirror -policy test-policy`
.	Verify that mirroring is active:
`snapmirror show -policy-type continuous -fields status`
