If the data in a source bucket becomes unavailable, you can break the SnapMirror relationship to make the destination bucket writable and begin serving data.

.About this task

When a takeover operation is performed, source bucket is converted to read-only and original destination bucket is converted to read-write, thereby reversing the S3 SnapMirror relationship.

When the disabled source bucket is available again, S3 SnapMirror automatically resynchronizes the contents of the two buckets. It is not necessary to explicitly resynchronize the relationship, as is required for volume SnapMirror deployments.

The takeover operation must be initiated from the remote cluster.

== System Manager procedure

Failover from the unavailable bucket and begin serving data:

. Click *Protection > Relationships*, then select the bucket.
. Click icon:ellipsis-v[] , select *Failover*, then click *Failover*.

== CLI procedure

.	Initiate a failover operation for the destination bucket:
`snapmirror failover start -destination-path _{svm_name:/bucket/bucket_name|cluster_name:// svm_name:/bucket/bucket_name, ...}_`
.	Verify the status of the failover operation:
`snapmirror show -fields status`
+
.Example
+
`dest_cluster::> snapmirror failover start -destination-path dest_cluster://vs1/bucket/test-bucket-mirror`
