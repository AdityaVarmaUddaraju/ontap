Make sure that your source and target environments meet the requirements for S3 SnapMirror backup protection to cloud targets.
You must have valid account credentials with the object store provider to access the data bucket.

Intercluster network interfaces and an IPspace should be configured on the cluster before the cluster can connect to a cloud object store. You should create enter cluster network interfaces on each node to seamlessly transfer data from the local storage to the cloud object store.

For StorageGRID targets, you need to know the following information:

* server name, expressed as a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN)
* bucket name; the bucket must already exist
* access key
* secret key

In addition, a StorageGRID certificate needs to be installed on the ONTAP S3 system using the `security certificate install command`. For more information, see link:../fabricpool/install-ca-certificate-storagegrid-task.html[Installing a CA certificate]  if you use StorageGRID.

For AWS S3 targets, you need to know the following information:

* server name, expressed as a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN)
* bucket name; the bucket must already exist
* access key
* secret key
