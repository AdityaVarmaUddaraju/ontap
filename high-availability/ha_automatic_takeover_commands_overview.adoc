[.lead]
Automatic takeover is enabled by default on all supported NetApp FAS, AFF, and ASA platforms.

In certain situations, you might need to change the default behavior and control when automatic takeovers occur. <Table 2> illustrates this information.

*QUESTION: What situations?*

[cols=2*,options="header"]
|===
|If you want takeover to occur automatically when the partner node... |Use this command...

|Reboots
|`storage failover modify ‑node nodename ‑onreboot true`
|Panics
|`storage failover modify ‑node nodename ‑onpanic true`
|===

== Enable email notification if the takeover capability is disabled

To receive prompt notification if the takeover capability becomes disabled, you should configure your system to enable automatic email notification for the `takeover impossible` EMS messages:

* `ha.takeoverImpVersion`
* `ha.takeoverImpLowMem`
* `ha.takeoverImpDegraded`
* `ha.takeoverImpUnsync`
* `ha.takeoverImpIC`
* `ha.takeoverImpHotShelf`
* `ha.takeoverImpNotDef`

== System events that result in an automatic takeover

*QUESTION: We should assume storage failover is enabled, yes? If so, aren’t these system events mostly covered at the very start of this document?*

Some events lead to an automatic takeover if storage failover is enabled.

The following system events cause an automatic and unavoidable takeover of the node.

* The node cannot send heartbeat messages to its partner due to events such as loss of power or watchdog reset.
* You halt the node without using the `-f` or `-inhibit-takeover` parameter.

If the `onpanic` parameter is set to `true`, a node panic also causes an automatic takeover. If `onpanic` is set to `false` a node panic does not cause an automatic takeover.
