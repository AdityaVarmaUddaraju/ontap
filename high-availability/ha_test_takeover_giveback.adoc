After you configure all aspects of your HA pair, you need to verify that it is operating as expected in maintaining uninterrupted access to both nodes' storage during takeover and giveback operations. Throughout the takeover process, the local (or takeover) node should continue serving the data normally provided by the partner node. During giveback, control and delivery of the partner's storage should return to the partner node.
