Takeover is the process in which a node assumes control of its partner's storage.

Giveback is the process in which the storage is returned to the partner.

By default, takeovers occur automatically when:

* A software or system failure occurs that leads to a panic. After the partner has recovered from the panic and booted up, the node automatically performs a giveback, returning the partner to normal operation.
* A system failure occurs (for example, a loss of power) and cannot reboot. QUESTION: Is this bullet referring to a system failure on the partner node only?

[NOTE]
If the storage for a node also loses power at the same time, a standard takeover is not possible.

* Heartbeat messages are not received from the node's partner. This could happen if the partner experienced a hardware or software failure that did not result in a panic but still prevented it from functioning correctly.
* You halt one of the nodes without using the `-f` or `-inhibit-takeover true` parameter.

[NOTE]
In a two-node cluster with cluster HA enabled, halting or rebooting a node using the `‑inhibit‑takeover true` parameter causes both nodes to stop serving data unless you first disable cluster HA and then assign epsilon to the node that you want to remain online.

* You reboot one of the nodes without using the `‑inhibit‑takeover true` parameter. (The `-onreboot `parameter of the `storage failover` command is enabled by default.)
* The remote  management device (Service Processor) detects failure of the partner node. (Not applicable if you disable hardware-assisted takeover.)

You can also manually initiate takeovers with the `storage failover takeover` command.
