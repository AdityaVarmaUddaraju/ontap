a|Whether failover is enabled or has occurred, or reasons why failover is not currently possible
a|`storage failover show`
a|View the nodes on which the storage failover HA-mode setting is enabled
You must set the value to ha for the node to participate in a storage failover (HA pair) configuration.
The `non-ha` value is used only in a stand-alone, or single node cluster configuration.
a|`storage failover show -fields mode`
a|Whether hardware-assisted takeover is enabled
a|`storage failover hwassist show`
a|The history of hardware-assisted takeover events that have occurred
a|`storage failover hwassist stats show`
a|The progress of a takeover operation as the partner's aggregates are moved to the node doing the takeover
a|`storage failover show‑takeover`
a|The progress of a giveback operation in returning aggregates to the partner node
a|`storage failover show‑giveback`
a|Whether an aggregate is home during takeover or giveback operations
a|`aggregate show ‑fields home‑id,owner‑id,home‑name,owner‑name,is‑home`
a|Whether cluster HA is enabled (applies only to two node clusters)
a|`cluster ha show`
a|The HA state of the components of an HA pair (on systems that use the HA state)
a|`ha‑config show`
This is a Maintenance mode command.
