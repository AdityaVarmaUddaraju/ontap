[.lead]
In certain situations, you might need to manage your automatic giveback settings using ONTAP commands.

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
a|
*If you want to...*
|*Use this command...*
|
____
Enable automatic giveback so that giveback occurs as soon as the
taken-over node boots, reaches the Waiting for Giveback state, and the
Delay before Auto Giveback period has expired.

The default setting is true.
____

a|
storage failover modify ‑node _nodename_

‑auto‑giveback true

a|
Disable automatic giveback. The default setting is true.

____
*Note:* Setting this parameter to false does not disable automatic
giveback after takeover on panic and takeover on reboot; automatic
giveback after takeover on panic must be disabled by setting the
``‑auto‑giveback‑after‑panic` parameter to false.
____

a|
storage failover modify ‑node _nodename_

‑auto‑giveback false

a|
____
Disable automatic giveback after takeover on panic (this setting is
enabled by default).
____

a|
storage failover modify ‑node _nodename_

‑auto‑giveback‑after‑panic false

a|
Delay automatic giveback for a specified number of seconds (default is
600).

This option determines the minimum time that a node remains in takeover
before performing an automatic giveback.

a|
storage failover modify ‑node _nodename_

‑delay‑seconds _seconds_

== How variations of the storage failover modify command affect automatic giveback

The operation of automatic giveback depends on how you configure the parameters of the storage failover modify command.

The following table lists the storage failover modify command parameters that apply to takeover events not caused by a panic:

[cols=2*,options="header"]
|===
|Parameter| Default setting

|`-auto-giveback true|false`
|true
|`-delay-seconds integer (seconds)`
|600
|`-onreboot true|false`
|true
|===


The following table describes how combinations of the `-onreboot` and `-auto-giveback` parameters affect automatic giveback for takeover events not caused by a panic.

MISSING TABLE

[NOTE]
If the `-onreboot` parameter is set to true and a takeover occurs due to a reboot, then automatic giveback is always performed, regardless of whether the `-auto-giveback` parameter is set to true.

When the ``-onreboot` parameter is set to false, a takeover does not occur in the case of a node reboot. Therefore, automatic giveback cannot occur, regardless of whether the `-auto-giveback` parameter is set to true. A client disruption occurs.

== The effects of automatic giveback parameter combinations that apply to panic situations.

The following table lists the `storage failover modify` command parameters that apply to panic situations:

MISSING TABLE

The following table describes how parameter combinations of the `storage failover modify` command affect automatic giveback in panic situations.


[cols=2*,options="header"]
|===
|storage failover parameters used |Does automatic giveback occur after panic?

|-onpanic `false`
-auto-giveback-after-panic `true`
|Not applicable
|-onpanic `false`
-auto-giveback-after-panic `false`
|Not applicable
|-onpanic `true`
-auto-giveback `true`

-auto-giveback-after-panic `true`
|Yes
|-onpanic `true`
-auto-giveback `false`
-auto-giveback-after-panic `false`
|No
|-onpanic `false`
If -onpanic is set to `false`, takeover/giveback does not occur, regardless of the value set for -auto-giveback or - auto-giveback-after-panic
|No
|===

NOTE: If the -onpanic parameter is set to `true`, automatic giveback is always performed if a panic occurs. If the -onpanic parameter is set to `false`, takeover does not occur. Therefore, automatic giveback cannot occur, even if the ‑auto‑giveback‑after‑panic parameter is set to `true`. A client disruption occurs.
