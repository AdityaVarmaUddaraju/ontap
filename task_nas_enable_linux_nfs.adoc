Modify storage VMs to enable NFS servers for serving data to Linux clients.

This procedure enables an existing storage VM. It assumes that configuration details are available for any authentication or security services required in your environment.

//Question: Is it necessary to create a new export policy for the root volume, or should we modify the default policy?

.Steps

. Enable NFS on an existing VM: click *Storage > Storage VMs*, select a storage VM, click *Settings*, and then click image:icon_gear.gif[settings icon] in the NFS tile.

. Open the export policy of the storage VM root volume:

.. Click *Storage > Volumes*, select the root volume of the storage VM (which by default is _volume-name_ _root), and then click on the policy that is displayed under *Export Policy*.

.. Click *Add* to add a rule.

*** Client specification = `0.0.0.0/0`

*** Access protocols = NFS

*** Access details = UNIX Read-Only

. Configure DNS for host-name resolution: click *Storage > Storage VMs*, select the storage VM, click *Settings*, and then click image:icon_gear.gif[settings icon] in the DNS tile.

. Configure name services as required.

.. Click *Storage > Storage VMs*, select the storage VM, click *Settings*, and then click for image:icon_gear.gif[settings icon] LDAP or NIS.

.. Include any changes in the name services switch file: click image:icon_pencil.gif[edit icon] in the Name Services Switch tile.

. Configure Kerberos if required:

.. Click *Storage > Storage VMs*, select the storage VM, and then click *Settings*.

.. Click image:icon_arrow.gif[arrow icon] in the Kerberos tile and then click *Add*.
