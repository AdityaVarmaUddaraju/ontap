ONTAP System Manager provides an easy interface that lets you create and manage clusters in your environment.

== Creating clusters

When you set up of clusters with System Manager on available nodes, you can configure the following:

* Cluster name

* Password

* Cluster-management IP address

* Node-management IP address (for discovered nodes)

* Domain name service (DNS) information

* Name server (NTP) information

* System backup (for single-node clusters)

== Monitoring clusters

The System Manager Dashboard lets you determine the following information:

*  *Health*: How healthy is the cluster.
*  *Capacity*: What capacity is available on the cluster.
*  *Performance*: How well is the cluster performing, based on latency, IOPS, and throughput.
*  *Network*: How is the network configured with hosts and storage objects, such as ports, interfaces, and storage VMs.
