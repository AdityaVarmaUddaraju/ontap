ONTAP System Manager provides an easy interface that lets you create and manage clusters in your environment.

The System Manager Dashboard lets you determine the following information:

== Health

You can monitor the health of a cluster.  Alerts are shown when problems arise.

== Capacity

System Manager shows you the available capacity on the cluster.

== Performance

You can monitor how well the cluster is performing, based on latency, IOPS, and throughput.  The metrics are graphed every 15 seconds by hour, day, week, month, or year.

== Network

You can view how the network is configured with hosts and storage objects.  You can view the number of ports that are available and the interfaces and storage VMs that are associated with them.
