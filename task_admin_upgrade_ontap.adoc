You can nondisruptively update the version of ONTAP on your cluster.

The update process checks your hardware platform and configuration to verify that your system is supported by ONTAP version to which you are upgrading and ONTAP automatically shift workloads during an upgrade between clusters so that you can continue serving data.

This procedure updates your system to the specified version of ONTAP. It assumes that your hardware platform and configuration is supported for the target release.
