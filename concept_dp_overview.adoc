You can use System Manager to protect your data by creating and managing mirror relationships, vault relationships, and mirror and vault relationships. You can also create and manage the Snapshot copy policies and schedules.

System Manager provides two default protection policies: asynchronous and synchronous. You can also create custom policies.
