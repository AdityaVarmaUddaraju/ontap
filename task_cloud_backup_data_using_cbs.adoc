* You should have a SnapMirror license.
* The WORM feature should be disabled.
* Intercluster LIFs should be configured.
* NTP should be configured.
* Cluster must be running ONTAP 9.9.1.
* You cannot use the feature for the following cluster configurations:
** The cluster cannot be in a MetroCluster environment.
** SVM-DR is not supported.
** FlexGroups cannot be backed up using the Cloud Backup Service.

.Steps

. When provisioning a volume or LUN, on the *Protection* page, select the checkbox labeled *Enable SnapMirror (Local or Remote)*.

. Select *Enable Cloud Backup Service*.

== Protect existing volumes or LUNs on the cloud

You can establish a SnapMirror protection relationship for existing volumes and LUNs.

.Steps

. Select an existing volume or LUN, and click *Protect*.

. On the *Protect Volumes* page, specify  "Backup using Cloud Backup Service" for the protection policy.

. Click *Protect*.

. On the *Protection* page, select the checkbox labeled *Enable SnapMirror (Local or Remote)*.

. Select *Enable Cloud Backup Service*.

== Restore data from backup files
You can perform backup management operations, such as restoring data, updating relationships, and deleting relationships, only with Cloud Manager.  Refer to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/occm/task_restore_backups.html[Restoring data from backup files] for more information.
