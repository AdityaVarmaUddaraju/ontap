File System Analytics is designed to provide visibility on volumes with active NAS data volumes. 

== Restrictions

File System Analytics is not available for the following volume types:

* SnapMirror destination volumes
* SnapLock volumes
* Volumes containing LUNs
* Volumes used only to hold SMB audit logs (MDV volumes)
* Node root volumes (/mroot)
* FlexCache destination volumes

== Performance recommendations

Enabling File System Analytics could incur a performance impact. Use Performance Manager to track the performance of the volumes you monitor. If you identify impacts to the performance of your monitored volumes, you can disable analytics if your testing shows that the performance impact is unacceptable

* Do not enable analytics if maximal performance is required in your environment. You can also disable analytics if your testing shows that the performance impact is unacceptable. When you disable analytics, previously collected data is no longer displayed for that volume.
* If you have enabled File System Analytics on volumes whose containing SVM is in a protection relationship, the analytics data is not replicated to the destination SVM. If the source SVM must be resynchronized in a recovery operation, you must manually reenable analytics on desired volumes after recovery.
* Beginning with ONTAP 9.9.1, File System Analytics is available for volumes transitioned from 7-mode systems.Because File System Analytics can consume storage space, it should not be run on transitioned volumes that are close to maximum capacity.
