Beginning with ONTAP 9.2, you can perform an automated update of a single-node cluster. Because single-node clusters lack redundancy, updates are always disruptive.

* You must have satisfied upgrade preparation requirements.

. Delete the previous ONTAP software package: `cluster image package delete -version previous_package_version`
. Download the target ONTAP software package: `cluster image package get -url location`
+
----
cluster1::> cluster image package get -url http://www.example.com/software/9.7/image.tgz

Package download completed.
Package processing completed.
----

. Verify that the software package is available in the cluster package repository: `cluster image package show-repository`
+
----
cluster1::> cluster image package show-repository
Package Version  Package Build Time
---------------- ------------------
9.7              M/DD/YYYY 10:32:15
----

. Verify that the cluster is ready to be upgraded: `cluster image validate -version package_version_number`
+
----
cluster1::> cluster image validate -version 9.7

WARNING: There are additional manual upgrade validation checks that must be performed after these automated validation checks have completed...
----

. Monitor the progress of the validation: `cluster image show-update-progress`
. Complete all required actions identified by the validation.
. Optionally, generate a software upgrade estimate: `cluster image update -version package_version_number -estimate-only`
+
The software upgrade estimate displays details about each component to be updated, and the estimated duration of the upgrade.

. Perform the software upgrade: `cluster image update -version package_version_number`
+
NOTE: If an issue is encountered, the update pauses and prompts you to take corrective action. You can use the cluster image show-update-progress command to view details about any issues and the progress of the update. After correcting the issue, you can resume the update by using the cluster image resume-update command.

. Display the cluster update progress: `cluster image show-update-progress`
+
The node is rebooted as part of the update and cannot be accessed while rebooting.

. Trigger a notification: `autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message "Finishing_Upgrade"`
+
If your cluster is not configured to send messages, a copy of the notification is saved locally.
