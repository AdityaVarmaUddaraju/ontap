After all of the HA pairs have been upgraded, you must use the version command to verify that all of the nodes are running the target release.

The cluster version is the lowest version of ONTAP running on any node in the cluster. If the cluster version is not the target ONTAP release, you can upgrade your cluster.

. Verify that the cluster version is the target ONTAP release: `version`
. If the cluster version is not the target ONTAP release, you can verify the upgrade status of all nodes``system node upgrade-revert show``
