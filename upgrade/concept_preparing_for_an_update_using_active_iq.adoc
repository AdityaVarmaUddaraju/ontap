Active IQ Digital Advisor identifies issues in your environment that can be resolved by upgrading to a newer version of ONTAP and the Upgrade Advisor component helps you plan for a successful upgrade.

Before upgrading, you should launch Active IQ and review the Active IQ health summary to help assess the health of your cluster.
