Before performing a reversion, you must install the target ONTAP software image on each node in the cluster.

You must have obtained the ONTAP software images.

. Set the privilege level to advanced, entering *y* when prompted to continue:``set -privilege advanced``
+
The advanced prompt (*>) appears.

. Choose one of the following options based on your requirements:
+
|===
| If you want to...| Run this command...
a|
Download, but not install, the software image
a|
`system node image get -node * -package location -replace-package true -background true`     This command downloads the software image to all of the nodes simultaneously. To download the image to each node one at a time, do not specify the -background parameter.
a|
Install a previously downloaded software image
a|
`system node image update -node * -package image_name -background true`     Note the following considerations for this command:

 ** You need to set the privilege level to advanced (set -privilege advanced), entering *y* when prompted to continue.
 ** If you are unsure of the image name to install, then you can view a list of previously downloaded software images by using the system node image package show command.
 ** This command installs the software image on all of the nodes simultaneously.
+
To install the image on each node one at a time, do not specify the -background parameter.

a|
Download and install the software image in the same operation
a|
`system node image update -node * -package location -replace-package true -background true`     Note the following considerations for this command:

 ** You need to set the privilege level to advanced (set -privilege advanced), entering *y* when prompted to continue.
 ** This command downloads and installs the software image on all of the nodes simultaneously. To download and install the image on each node one at a time, do not specify the -background parameter.

. Verify that the software image is downloaded and installed on each node: `system node image show-update-progress -node *`
+
This command displays the current status of the software image download and installation. You should continue to run this command until all nodes report a Run Status of Exited, and an Exit Status of Success.
+
The following example shows a 2-node cluster in which the software image has been downloaded and installed successfully on both nodes:
