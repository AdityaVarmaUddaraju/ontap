You can nondisruptively update the version of ONTAP on your cluster using System Manager.

Take a look at the simplified ONTAP upgrade capabilities available in ONTAP 9.8 System Manager.

The update process checks your hardware platform and configuration to verify that your system is supported by the ONTAP version to which you are upgrading. ONTAP automatically shifts workloads during an upgrade between clusters so you can continue serving data.

This procedure updates your system to the specified version of ONTAP. It is assumed that your hardware platform and configuration is supported for the target release.

NOTE: If issues are encountered during your automated upgrade, you can view EMS messages and details in ONTAP System Manager:  Click *Events & Jobs* > *Events*.

.Steps

. If you want to download the software image to an HTTP or FTP server on your network, copy the software image from the NetApp support site to the directory on the HTTP or FTP server from which the image will be served.
+
If you want to download the software image to a local folder, then click the software image on the NetApp support site, select *Save As*, and then choose the local folder to place the image.

. Depending on the System Manager version that you are running, perform one of the following steps:

. Click *Validate* to run the pre-update validation checks to verify whether the cluster is ready for an update.
+
The validation operation checks the cluster components to validate that the update can be completed nondisruptively, and then displays any errors or warnings. It also displays any required remedial action that you must perform before updating the software.
+
IMPORTANT: You must perform all of the required remedial actions for the errors before proceeding with the update. Although you can ignore the remedial actions for the warnings, the best practice is to perform all of the remedial actions before proceeding with the update.

. Click *Next*.
. Click *Update*.
+
Validation is performed again.
+
* When the validation is complete, a table displays any errors and warnings, along with any required remedial actions to be taken before proceeding.
+
* If the validation is completed with warnings, you can choose to select the *Continue update with warnings* checkbox, and then click *Continue*.
+
When the validation is complete and the update is in progress, the update might be paused because of errors. You can click the error message to view the details, and then perform the remedial actions before resuming the update.

After the update is completed successfully, the node reboots, and you are redirected to the ONTAP System Manager login page. If the node takes a long time to reboot, you must refresh your browser.
