If an automated upgrade pauses because of an error, you can resolve the error and resume the automated upgrade, or you can cancel the automated upgrade and complete the process manually. If you choose to continue the automated upgrade, do not perform any of the upgrade steps manually.

If you want to manually complete the upgrade, use the cluster image cancel-update command to cancel the automated process and proceed manually. If you want to continue the automated upgrade, complete the following steps.

. View the upgrade error: `cluster image show-update-progress`
. Resolve the error.
. Resume the update: `cluster image resume-update`
