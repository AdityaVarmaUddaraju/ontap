[.lead]
Before and after you upgrade, revert, or downgrade a cluster, you should verify that the nodes are healthy and eligible to participate in the cluster, and that the cluster is in quorum.

. Verify that the nodes in the cluster are online and are eligible to participate in the cluster: `cluster show`
+
----
cluster1::> cluster show
Node                  Health  Eligibility
--------------------- ------- ------------
node0                 true    true
node1                 true    true
----
+
If any node is unhealthy or ineligible, check EMS logs for errors and take corrective action.

. Set the privilege level to advanced: `set -privilege advanced`
. Enter `y` to continue.
. Verify the configuration details for each RDB process.
 ** The relational database epoch and database epochs should match for each node.
 ** The per-ring quorum master should be the same for all nodes.
+
Note that each ring might have a different quorum master.

+

| To display this RDB process...| Enter this command...
a|
Management application
a|
`cluster ring show -unitname mgmt`
a|
Volume location database
a|
`cluster ring show -unitname vldb`
a|
Virtual-Interface manager
a|
`cluster ring show -unitname vifmgr`
a|
SAN management daemon
a|
`cluster ring show -unitname bcomd`
|===
This example shows the volume location database process:
+
----
cluster1::*> cluster ring show -unitname vldb
Node      UnitName Epoch    DB Epoch DB Trnxs Master    Online
--------- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------- ---------
node0     vldb     154      154      14847    node0     master
node1     vldb     154      154      14847    node0     secondary
node2     vldb     154      154      14847    node0     secondary
node3     vldb     154      154      14847    node0     secondary
4 entries were displayed.
----
. If you are operating in a SAN environment, verify that each node is in a SAN quorum: `event log show -messagename scsiblade.*`
+
The most recent scsiblade event message for each node should indicate that the scsi-blade is in quorum.
+
----
cluster1::*> event log show -messagename scsiblade.*
Time                Node             Severity      Event
------------------- ---------------- ------------- ---------------------------
MM/DD/YYYY TIME  node0            INFORMATIONAL scsiblade.in.quorum: The scsi-blade ...
MM/DD/YYYY TIME  node1            INFORMATIONAL scsiblade.in.quorum: The scsi-blade ...
----

. Return to the admin privilege level: `set -privilege admin`
