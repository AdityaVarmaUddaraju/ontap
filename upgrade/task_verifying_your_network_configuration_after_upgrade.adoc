ONTAP 9.8 and later automatically monitors layer 2 reachability. After you upgrade from ONTAP 9.7x or earlier to ONTAP 9.8 or later, you should verify that each .network port has reachability to its expected broadcast domain.

. Verify each port has reachability to its expected domain:``network port reachability show -detail``
+
A reachability-status of ok indicates that the port has layer 2 reachability to its assigned domain.

. See https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/networking-app/[Verify your network configuration after upgrading].
