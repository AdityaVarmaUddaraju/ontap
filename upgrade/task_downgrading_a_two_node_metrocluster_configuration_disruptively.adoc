A two-node MetroCluster (MCC) configuration can only be downgraded from ONTAP 9.1 to ONTAP 9 disruptively.

A two-node MCC configuration cannot be downgraded from ONTAP 9.2 to ONTAP 9.1. You can only revert from ONTAP 9.2 to an earlier version of ONTAP.

. Disable automatic unplanned switchover (AUSO) on both the clusters: `metrocluster modify -auto-switchover-failure-domain auso-disabled`
. Verify that AUSO is disabled: `metrocluster show`
+
AUSO Failure Domain is auso-disabled.

. Set the privilege level to advanced, entering *y* when prompted to continue: `set -privilege advanced`
+
The advanced prompt (`*>`) appears.

. Perform the following steps on site A, and then repeat the same steps on site B.
 .. Install the ONTAP 9 software image and set it as the default: `system node image update -package package_location`
 .. Disable the new features and capabilities that are not available in ONTAP 9.
 .. Verify that the target software image is set as the default image: `system node image show`
+
The following example shows that the 9.0 image is set as the default image:

 .. Reboot the node: `system node reboot -node nodename`
 .. After the reboot is complete, verify that the storage virtual machines (SVMs) are running and the LIFS are online: `network interface show -vserver vserver_name`
. Enable AUSO on both clusters: `metrocluster modify -auto-switchover-failure-domain auso-on-cluster-disaster`
. Verify that AUSO is enabled: `metrocluster show`
+
AUSO Failure Domain is auso-on-cluster-disaster.

. Validate the configuration: `metrocluster check`
