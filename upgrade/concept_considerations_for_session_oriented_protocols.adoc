Clusters and session-oriented protocols might cause adverse effects on clients and applications in certain areas during upgrades.

If you are using session-oriented protocols, consider the following:

* CIFS
+
Hyper-V and SQL Server over SMB support nondisruptive operations (NDOs). If you configured a Hyper-V or SQL Server over SMB solution, the application servers and the contained virtual machines or databases remain online and provide continuous availability during the ONTAP upgrade.
+
For all other CIFS configurations, client sessions are terminated. You should direct users to end their sessions before you upgrade.

* NFSv4.x
+
NFSv4.x clients will automatically recover from connection losses experienced during the upgrade using normal NFSv4.x recovery procedures. Applications might experience a temporary I/O delay during this process.

* NDMP
+
State is lost and the client user must retry the operation.

* Backups and restores
+
State is lost and the client user must retry the operation.
+
IMPORTANT: Do not initiate a backup or restore during or immediately before an upgrade. Doing so might result in data loss.

* Applications (for example, Oracle or Exchange)
+
Effects depend on the applications. For timeout-based applications, you might be able to change the timeout setting to longer than the ONTAP reboot time to minimize adverse effects.
