This content describes how to manage Snapshot copies on a local ONTAP system, and how to replicate Snapshot copies to a remote system using SnapMirror. You can replicate Snapshot copies for disaster recovery or long-term retention.

You should use this content under the following circumstances:

* You want to understand the range of ONTAP backup and recovery capabilities.
* You want to use the command-line interface (CLI), not ONTAP System Manager, an automated scripting tool, or a SnapCenter product.
* You have already created peer relationships between the source and destination clusters and the source and destination SVMs.

* You are backing up volumes or SVMs from AFF or FAS storage systems to AFF or FAS storage systems.
 ** If you are replicating Element volumes to ONTAP, or ONTAP LUNs to an Element system, see the NetApp Element software documentation.

* You want to provide data protection using online methods, not tape.
