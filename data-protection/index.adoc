This content describes how to manage Snapshot copies on a local ONTAP system, and how to replicate Snapshot copies to a remote system using SnapMirror. You can replicate Snapshot copies for disaster recovery or long-term retention.

You should use this content under the following circumstances:

* You want to understand the range of ONTAP backup and recovery capabilities.
* You want to use the command-line interface (CLI), not ONTAP System Manager, an automated scripting tool, or a SnapCenter product.
* You have already created peer relationships between the source and destination clusters and the source and destination SVMs.
+
https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/peering/index.html[Cluster and SVM peering]

* You are backing up volumes or SVMs from AFF or FAS storage systems to AFF or FAS storage systems.
 ** If you are replicating Element volumes to ONTAP, or ONTAP LUNs to an Element system, see the NetApp Element software documentation.

* You want to provide data protection using online methods, not tape.

If you want more information about the SnapMirror Business Continuity feature added in ONTAP 9.8, which provides Zero Recovery Time Objective (Zero RTO) or Transparent Application Failover (TAF) to enable automatic failover of business-critical applications in SAN environments, see the following documentation: https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/smbc[NetApp Documentation: SnapMirror Business Continuity]

If you want to quickly perform volume backup and recovery using best practices, you should choose among the following documentation:
