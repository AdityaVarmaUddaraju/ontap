A Snapshot policy requires at least one Snapshot copy job schedule. You can use the `job schedule cron create` command to create a job schedule.

.About this task

By default, ONTAP forms the names of Snapshot copies by appending a timestamp to the job schedule name.

If you specify values for both day of the month and day of the week, the values are considered independently. For example, a cron schedule with the day specification `Friday` and the day of the month specification `13` runs every Friday and on the 13th day of each month, not just on every Friday the 13th.

.Step

. Create a job schedule:
+
`job schedule cron create -name _job_name_ -month month -dayofweek _day_of_week_ -day _day_of_month_ -hour _hour_ -minute _minute_`
+
For `-month`, `-dayofweek`, and `-hour`, you can specify `all` to run the job every month, day of the week, and hour, respectively.
+
The following example creates a job schedule named `myweekly` that runs on Saturdays at 3:00 a.m.:
+
----
cluster1::> job schedule cron create -name myweekly -dayofweek "Saturday" -hour 3 -minute 0
----
+
The following example creates a schedule named `myweeklymulti` that specifies multiple days, hours and minutes:
+
----
job schedule cron create -name myweeklymulti -dayofweek "Monday,Wednesday,Sunday" -hour 3,9,12 -minute 0,20,50
