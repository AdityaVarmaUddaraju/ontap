Create LUNs to provide storage for a Windows server using the FC or iSCSI SAN protocol. LUNs appear as disks to the Windows host.

This procedure creates new LUNs on an existing storage VM. Your FC or iSCSI protocol should already be set up.

NOTE: Beginning in ONTAP 9.8, when you provision storage, QoS is enabled by default. You can disable QoS or choose a custom QoS policy during the provisioning process or at a later time.

.Steps

. On your Windows server, install Data ONTAP DSM for Windows MPIO.

. In ONTAP System Manager, click *Storage > LUNs*, and then click *Add*.
+
If you need to create a new initiator group, click *More Options*.
+
If you are running ONTAP 9.8 or later, and you want to disable QoS or choose a custom QoS policy click *More Options* and then select *Performance Service Level*.

. For FC, zone your FC switches by WWPN. Use one zone per initiator and include all target ports in each zone.

. On your Windows server, discover the new LUN.

. Initialize the LUN and optionally format it with a file system.

. Verify the Windows server can write and read data on the LUN.
