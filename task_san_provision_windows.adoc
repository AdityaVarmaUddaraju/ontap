Create LUNs to provide storage for a Windows server using the FC or iSCSI SAN protocol. LUNs appear as disks to the Windows host.

This procedure creates new LUNs on an existing storage VM. Your FC or iSCSI protocol should already be set up.

.Steps

. On your Windows server, install Data ONTAP DSM for Windows MPIO.

. In ONTAP System Manager, click *Storage > LUNs*, and then click *Add*.

. Enter the information for your LUN, select Windows as the host operating system and Save.

. For FC, zone your FC switches by WWPN. Use one zone per initiator and include all target ports in each zone.

. On your Windows server, discover the new LUN.

. Initialize the LUN and optionally format it with a file system.

. Verify the Windows server can write and read data on the LUN.
