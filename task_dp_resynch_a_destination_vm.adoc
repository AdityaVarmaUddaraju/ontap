[.lead]
Starting in System Manager 9.8, you can resynchronize the data and configuration details from the source SVM to the destination SVM in a broken protection relationship and reestablish the relationship.

You perform the resync operation only from the destination of the original relationship. The resync deletes any data in the destination storage VM that is newer than the data in the source storage VM.

.Steps
.	Select the desired protection relationship: click *Protection > Relationships*.
.	Click image:icon_kabob.gif[kabob icon] and click *Resync*.
.	Under *Relationships*, monitor the resynchronization progress by viewing *Transfer Status* for the relationship.
