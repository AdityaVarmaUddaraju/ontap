This content describes ONTAP file access features available for the NFS protocol. It shows you how to enable an NFS server and how to export volumes or qtrees. It includes planning guidance and detailed implementation instructions.

*You should use this content* under the following circumstances:

* You want to understand the range of ONTAP NFS protocol capabilities.
* You want to perform less common configuration and maintenance tasks, not basic NFS configuration.
* You want to use the command-line interface (CLI), not ONTAP System Manager or an automated scripting tool.

*If you want to create a basic configuration using best practices*, you should choose among the following documentation:

* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-sm-classic/nfs-config/index.html[NFS configuration - basic configuration using ONTAP System Manager]

* link:../nfs-config/index.html[NFS configuration - advanced configuration using the CLI]

*If you require additional configuration or conceptual information*, you should choose among the following documentation:

* Conceptual background for NFS features
