Beginning with ONTAP 9.2, you can display LDAP statistics for storage virtual machines (SVMs) on a storage system to monitor the performance and diagnose issues.

.What you'll need

* You must have configured an LDAP client on the SVM.
* You must have identified LDAP objects from which you can view data.

.Step

. View the performance data for counter objects:
+
`statistics show`

.Examples

The following example shows the performance data for object `secd_external_service_op`:

----
cluster::*> statistics show -vserver vserverName -object secd_external_service_op -instance “vserverName:LDAP (NIS & Name Mapping):GetUserInfoFromName:1.1.1.1”

Object: secd_external_service_op
Instance: vserverName:LDAP (NIS & Name Mapping):GetUserInfoFromName:1.1.1.1
