Consistency groups can be created with existing volumes or with new volumes. Once a volume is added to a consistency group, it cannot be added to another consistency group. A volume can be removed from a consistency group by deleting the volume or deleting the consistency group.

== Create a consistency group with new volumes

.Steps
. Select *Storage > Consistency groups*.
. Select *+Add.* then *Using New LUNs*.
. Name the consistency group. Designate the number of LUNs and capacity per LUN.
. Select the host operating system and LUN format. Enter the host initiator information.
. To configure protection policies, add a child consistency group, or show more options about host initiators, select *More options*
. Select *Save*.
. Confirm your consistency group has been created by returning to the main consistency group menu where it will appear once the ONTAP job completes. If you set a protection policy, look under the appropriate policy, remote or local, which should display a green shield with a checkmark.

== Create a consistency group with existing volumes
.Steps
. Select *Storage > Consistency groups*.
. Select *+Add.* then *Using existing volumes*.
. Name the consistency group and select the storage VM.
. Select the existing volumes to include. Only volumes that are not already part of a consistency group will be available for selection.

[Note]
If creating a consistency group with new volumes, the consistency group supports  FlexVol volumes. Volumes with Asynchronous or Synchronous SnapMirror relationships can be added to consistency groups, but they are not consistency group-aware. Consistency groups do not support S3 buckets, MCC, or SVMs with SVMDR relationships.

. Select *Save*.
. Confirm your consistency group has been created by returning to the main consistency group menu where it will appear once the ONTAP job completes. If you have chosen a protection policy, confirm it was properly set by selecting your consistency group from the menu. If you set a protection policy, look under the appropriate policy, remote or local, which should display a green shield with a checkmark.
