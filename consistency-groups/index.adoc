[.lead]
A consistency group is a collection of volumes that provides a write-order consistency guarantee for an application workload spanning multiple volumes. 

Consistency groups facilitate application workload management, providing easy management of local and remote protection policies and providing simultaneous crash-consistent or application-consistent Snapshot copies of a collection of volumes at a point in time. Snapshots in consistency groups enable an entire application workload to be restored. 

Consistency groups support any FlexVol volume regardless of protocol (NAS, SAN, or NVMe) and can be managed through the ONTAP REST APIs or in System Manager under the *Storage > Consistency Groups* menu item.

Consistency groups support both a single and hierarchical relationship. An individual consistency group is a collection of volumes.

Larger application workloads may require multiple consistency groups. In these situations, multiple consistency groups can be placed together in a hierarchical relationship. When placed in a hierarchical relationship, single consistency groups become the child components of a parent consistency group. The parent consistency group can include up to five child consistency groups as well as its own volumes.

== Protection

Consistency groups offer remote protection through SnapMirror Business Continuity (SM-BC)  and local protection through Snapshot policies. In order to utilize remote protection, you must meet the requirements for xref:../smbc/smbc_plan_prerequisites.html#licensing[SnapMirror Business Continuity deployments]. By default, consistency groups do not have a protection policy set and will not protect your data unless a policy is selected. See xref:protect-task.adoc[“Protect a consistency group”] for more information.

== Upgrade considerations

Consistency groups created with SM-BC in ONTAP 9.8 and 9.9 will automatically be upgraded and manageable under *Storage > Consistency Groups* in System Manager when upgrading to ONTAP 9.10.1. For more information about upgrading, see xref:../smbc/smbc_admin_upgrade_and_revert_considerations.adoc[SM-BC upgrade and revert considerations].

Consistency group snapshots created with the ONTAP REST API can be managed through System Manager’s Consistency Group interface and through consistency group API endpoints.

[Note]
Snapshots created with the ONTAPI commands `cg-start` and `cg-commit` will not be recognized as consistency group Snapshots and thus cannot be managed through System Manager’s Consistency Group interface or the consistency group API endpoints.
