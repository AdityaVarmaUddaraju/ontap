If you decide that you no longer need a consistency group, it can be deleted. 

Deleting a consistency group deletes the instance of the consistency group and does not impact the constituent volumes and LUNs. When deleting a consistency group, you will no longer have access to the Snapshots from the entire consistency group. Volume granular Snapshots of the associated volumes will remain.

Consistency groups will also be deleted if all or all but one of the constituent objects in a consistency group are deleted. Individual volumes can only be removed a consistency group if the volume itself is deleted. Deleting a volume automatically removes it from the consistency group.

.Steps
. In the consistency group menu under *Storage > Consistency groups*, select the consistency group you would like to delete.
. Next to the name of the consistency group, select image:../media/icons_kabob.gif[three vertical dots icon] and then *Delete*.
