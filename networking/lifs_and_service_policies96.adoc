You can assign service policies (instead of LIF roles) to LIFs that determine the kind of traffic that is supported for the LIFs. Service policies define a collection of network services supported by a LIF. ONTAP provides a set of built-in service policies that can be associated with a LIF.

== Service policies for system SVMs

The admin SVM and any system SVM contain service policies that can be used for LIFs in that SVM, including management and intercluster LIFs. These policies are automatically created by the system when an IPspace is created. The following table lists the built-in policies for LIFs in system SVMs:

[cols="20,20,20,40"]
|===
|Policy |Included services |Equivalent role |Description

|default-intercluster
|intercluster-core
|intercluster
|Used by LIFs carrying intercluster traffic.
Note: Available from ONTAP 9.5 with the name net-intercluster service policy.
|default-route-announce
|management-bgp
|-
|Used by LIFs carrying BGP peer connections
Note: Available from ONTAP 9.5 with the name net-route-announce service policy.
|default-management
|management-core, management-ems, management-ssh, management-https, management-autosupport
|node-mgmt, or cluster-mgmt
|Used by LIFs handling management requests. Management-ems controls which LIFs can publish EMS content.
|===

The following table lists the services that can be used on a system SVM along with any restrictions each service imposes on a LIF's failover policy:

[cols="20,20,60"]
|===
|Service |Failover limitations |Description

|intercluster-core
|home-node-only
|Core intercluster services
|management-core
|-
|Core management services
|management-ssh
|-
|Services for SSH management access
|management-https
|-
|Services for HTTPS management access
|management-autosupport
|-
|Services related to posting AutoSupport payloads
|management-bgp
|home-port-only
|Services related to BGP peer interactions
|===

== Service policies for data SVMs

All data SVMs contain service policies that can be used by LIFs in that SVM. The following table lists the built-in policies for LIFs in data SVMs:

[cols="20,20,20,40"]
|===
|Policy |Included services |Equivalent data protocol |Description

|default-management
|management-ssh, management-https
|none
|Used by LIFs handling management requests
|default-data-blocks
|data-iscsi
|iscsi
|Used by LIFs carrying block-oriented SAN data traffic
|default-data-files
|data-nfs, data-cifs, data-flexcache, data-fpolicy-client
|nfs, cifs, fcache
|Used by LIFs carrying file-oriented NAS data traffic.
|===

The following table lists the services that can be used on a data SVM along with any restrictions each service imposes on a LIF's failover policy:

[cols="20,20,20,40"]
|===
|Policy |Included services |Equivalent data protocol |Description

|management-ssh
|-
|-
|Services for SSH management access
|management-https
|-
|-
|Services for HTTPS management access
|data-core
|-
|data-only
|Core data services (see for more details.
|data-nfs
|-
|data-only
|Protocols related to NFS data service
|data-cifs
|-
|data-only
|Protocols related to CIFS data service
|data-flexcache
|-
|data-only
|Protocols related to FlexCache data service
|data-iscsi
|home-port-only
|data-only
|Protocols related to iSCSI data service
|===

You should be aware of how the service policies are assigned to the LIFs in data SVMs:

* If a data SVM is created with a list of data services, the built-in "default-data-files" and "default-data-blocks" service policies in that SVM are created using the specified services.
* If a data SVM is created without specifying a list of data services, the built-in "default-data-files" and "default-data-blocks" service policies in that SVM are created using a default list of data services.
+
The default data services list includes the iSCSI, NFS, SMB, and FlexCache services.
* When a LIF is created with a list of data protocols, a service policy equivalent to the specified data protocols is assigned to the LIF.
+
If an equivalent service policy does not exist, a custom service policy is created.
* When a LIF is created without a service policy or list of data protocols, the default-data-files service policy is assigned to the LIF by default.

== Data-core service

The data-core service allows components that previously used LIFs with the data role to work as expected on clusters that have been upgraded to manage LIFs using service policies instead of LIF roles (which are deprecated in ONTAP 9.6).

Specifying data-core as a service does not open any ports in the firewall, but the service should be included in any service policy in a data SVM. For example, the default-data-files service policy contains the following services by default:

* data-core
* data-nfs
* data-cifs
* data-flexcache

The data-core service should be included in the policy to ensure all applications using the LIF work as expected, but the other three services can be removed, if desired.
