IPspaces enable you to configure a single ONTAP cluster so that it can be accessed by clients from more than one administratively separate network domain, even if those clients are using the same IP address subnet range. This allows for separation of client traffic for privacy and security.

An IPspace defines a distinct IP address space in which storage virtual machines (SVMs) reside. Ports and IP addresses defined for an IPspace are applicable only within that IPspace. A distinct routing table is maintained for each SVM within an IPspace; therefore, no cross-SVM or cross- IPspace traffic routing occurs.

[NOTE]
IPspaces support both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses on their routing domains.

If you are managing storage for a single organization, then you do not need to configure IPspaces. If you are managing storage for multiple companies on a single ONTAP cluster, and you are certain that none of your customers have conflicting networking configurations, then you also do not need to use IPspaces. In many cases, the use of storage virtual machines (SVMs), with their own distinct IP routing tables, can be used to segregate unique networking configurations instead of using IPspaces.
