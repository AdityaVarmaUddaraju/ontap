You can add or remove a LIF from the DNS load balancing zone of a storage virtual machine (SVM). You can also remove all the LIFs simultaneously from a load balancing zone.

.Before you begin

* All the LIFs in a load balancing zone should belong to the same SVM.
* A LIF can be a part of only one DNS load balancing zone.
* Failover groups for each subnet must have been set up, if the LIFs belong to different subnets.

.About this task

A LIF that is in the administrative down status is temporarily removed from the DNS load balancing zone. When the LIF returns to the administrative up status, the LIF is automatically added to the DNS load balancing zone.

.Step

Add a LIF to or remove a LIF from a load balancing zone:

|Add a LIF
|network interface modify -vserver vserver_name -lif lif_name-dns-zone zone_name
Example:
network interface modify -vserver vs1 -lif data1 -dns-zone cifs.company.com
|Remove a single LIF
|network interface modify -vserver vserver_name -lif lif_name-dns-zone none
Example:
 network interface modify -vserver vs1 -lif data1 -dns-zone none
|Remove all LIFs
|network interface modify -vserver vserver_name -lif * -dns-zone none
Example:
network interface modify -vserver vs0 -lif * -dns-zone none
You can remove an SVM from a load balancing zone by removing all the LIFs in the SVM from that zone.
