This guide describes the detailed networking content for ONTAP 9 releases.

This guide describes basic storage network administration. It shows you how to configure physical and virtual network ports (VLANs and interface groups), how to create LIFs using IPv4 and IPv6, how to manage routing and host-resolution services in clusters, how to use load balancing to optimize network traffic, and how to monitor a cluster using SNMP.

You should use this guide under the following circumstances:

* You want to understand the range of ONTAP network management capabilities.
* You want to use the CLI, not ONTAP System Manager.
* You are configuring networking on a new or upgraded system running ONTAP 9.

If you want to follow NAS path failover best practices and are running an ONTAP 9.8 or later release, you should use the following documentation:

* link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/networking/set_up_nas_path_failover_98_and_later_cli.html[ONTAP 9.8 and later NAS Path Failover Workflow^]

If you want to follow NAS path failover best practices and are running an ONTAP 9.0 - 9.7 release, you should use the following documentation:

* link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/networking-manual-config/index.html[ONTAP 9.0 - 9.7 NAS Path Failover Workflow^]

If you want to use ONTAP System Manager to configure the network for ONTAP 9.7 and later, you should choose the following documentation:

*	link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/[ONTAP System Manager docs^]

If you require additional configuration or conceptual information, you should choose among the following documentation:

* Conceptual background for network configuration

* NAS file access
** link:../nfs-admin/index.html[NFS management^]
** https://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.cdot-famg-cifs/home.html[SMB management^]
* SAN host provisioning
** link:../san-admin/index.html[SAN administration^]
* Command reference

* Technical Reports (TRs), which include additional information about ONTAP technology and interaction with external services
