This content describes basic storage network administration. It shows you how to configure physical and virtual network ports (VLANs and interface groups), how to create LIFs using IPv4 and IPv6, how to manage routing and host-resolution services in clusters, how to use load balancing to optimize network traffic, and how to monitor a cluster using SNMP.

Unless otherwise stated, this content applies to all versions of ONTAP 9.
