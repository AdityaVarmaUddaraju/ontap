[.lead]
Quotas are applied to the Everyone group and the BUILTIN\Administrators group differently than to other Windows groups.

The following list describes what happens if the quota target is a special Windows group ID:

* If the quota target is the Everyone group, a file whose ACL shows that the owner is Everyone is counted under the SID for Everyone.
* If the quota target is BUILTIN\Administrators, the entry is considered a user quota, for tracking only.
+
You cannot impose restrictions on BUILTIN\Administrators.
+
If a member of BUILTIN\Administrators creates a file, the file is owned by BUILTIN\Administrators and is counted under the SID for BUILTIN\Administrators, not the user's personal SID.

[NOTE]
====
ONTAP does not support group quotas based on Windows group IDs. If you specify a Windows group ID as the quota target, the quota is considered to be a user quota.
