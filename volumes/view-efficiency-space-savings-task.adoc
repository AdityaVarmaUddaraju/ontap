You can view the amount of space savings achieved through deduplication and data compression on a volume by using the `volume show` command.

.About this task

The space savings in Snapshot copies are not included when calculating the space savings achieved on a volume. Using deduplication does not affect volume quotas. Quotas are reported at the logical level, and remain unchanged.

.Step

. Use the `volume show` command to view space savings achieved on a volume using deduplication and data compression.

.Example

The following command enables you to view the space savings achieved by using deduplication and data compression on volume VolA: `volume show -vserver vs1 -volume VolA`

cluster1::> volume show -vserver vs1 -volume VolA

                                 Vserver Name: vs1
                                  Volume Name: VolA
