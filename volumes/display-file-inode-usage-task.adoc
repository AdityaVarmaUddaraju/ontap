FlexVol volumes have a maximum number of files that they can contain. Knowing how many files are contained by your volumes helps you determine whether you need to increase the number of (public) inodes for your volumes to prevent them from hitting their maximum file limit.

.About this task

Public inodes can be either free (they are not associated with a file) or used (they point to a file). The number of free inodes for a volume is the total number of inodes for the volume minus the number of used inodes (the number of files).

If qtree-level and volume-level shares exist on the same FlexVol or SCVMM pool, the qtrees appear as directories on the FlexVol share. Therefore, you need to be careful not to delete them accidentally.

.Step

. To display inode usage for a volume, enter the following command:
+
`df -i volume_name`
+
You can omit the volume name; in this case, ONTAP displays the inode usage for all volumes in the cluster. You can also specify a storage virtual machine (SVM) to see only volumes on that SVM.
