Tracking quotas generate reports of disk and file usage and do not limit resource usage. When tracking quotas are used, modifying quota values is less disruptive, because you can resize quotas rather than turning them off and back on.

To create a tracking quota, you omit the Disk Limit and Files Limit parameters. This tells ONTAP to monitor disk and files usage for that target at that level (volume or qtree), without imposing any limits. Tracking quotas are indicated in the output of `show` commands and the quota report with a dash ("-") for all limits.

You can also specify a _default tracking quota_, which applies to all instances of the target. Default tracking quotas enable you to track usage for all instances of a quota type (for example, all qtrees or all users). In addition, they enable you use resizing rather than reinitialization when you want quota changes to take effect.

.Examples

The following quotas file shows tracking quotas in place for a specific user, group, and qtree:

----

#Quota target   type           disk files thold sdisk sfile
#-----------    ----           ---- ----- ----- ----- -----
kjones          user@/vol/vol1    -  -
eng1            group@/vol/vol1   -  -
proj1           tree@/vol/vol1    -  -
----

The following quotas file contains the three possible default tracking quotas (users, groups, and qtrees):

----

#Quota target   type           disk  files thold sdisk sfile
#-----------    ----           ----  ----- ----- ----- -----
*               user@/vol/vol1    -   -
*               group@/vol/vol1   -   -
*               tree@/vol/vol1    -   -
