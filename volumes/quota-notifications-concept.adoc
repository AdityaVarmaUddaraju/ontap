Quota notifications are messages that are sent to the event management system (EMS) and also configured as SNMP traps.

Notifications are sent in response to the following events:

* A hard quota is reached; in other words, an attempt is made to exceed it
* A soft quota is exceeded
* A soft quota is no longer exceeded

Thresholds are slightly different from other soft quotas. Thresholds trigger notifications only when they are exceeded, not when they are no longer exceeded.

Hard-quota notifications are configurable byusing the volume quota modify command. You can turn them off completely, and you can change their frequency, for example, to prevent sending of redundant messages.

Soft-quota notifications are not configurable because they are unlikely to generate redundant messages and their sole purpose is notification.

The following table lists the events that quotas send to the EMS system:
[cols="2*",options="header"]
|===
| When this occurs...| This event is sent to the EMS...
a|
A hard limit is reached in a tree quota
a|
`wafl.quota.qtree.exceeded`
a|
A hard limit is reached in a user quota on the volume
a|
`wafl.quota.user.exceeded` (for a UNIX user)
`wafl.quota.user.exceeded.win` (for a Windows user)

a|
A hard limit is reached in a user quota on a qtree
a|
`wafl.quota.userQtree.exceeded` (for a UNIX user)
`wafl.quota.userQtree.exceeded.win` (for a Windows user)

a|
A hard limit is reached in a group quota on the volume
a|
`wafl.quota.group.exceeded`
a|
A hard limit is reached in a group quota on a qtree
a|
`wafl.quota.groupQtree.exceeded`
a|
A soft limit, including a threshold, is exceeded
a|
`quota.softlimit.exceeded`
a|
A soft limit is no longer exceeded
a|
`quota.softlimit.normal`

The following table lists the SNMP traps that quotas generate:
[cols="2*",options="header"]

| When this occurs...| This SNMP trap is sent...
a|
A hard limit is reached
a|
quotaExceeded
a|
A soft limit, including a threshold, is exceeded
a|
quotaExceeded and softQuotaExceeded
a|
A soft limit is no longer exceeded
a|
quotaNormal and softQuotaNormal

[NOTE]
====
Notifications contain qtree ID numbers rather than qtree names. You can correlate qtree names to ID numbers by using the `volume qtree show -id` command.
