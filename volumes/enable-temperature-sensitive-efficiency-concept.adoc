summary: "Temperature sensitive storage efficiency was introduced in ONTAP 9.8 and is enabled automatically on newly created thin-provisioned AFF volumes. With this feature, storage efficiency is applied according to whether data is hot or cold. For cold data, larger data blocks are compressed, and for hot data, which is overwritten more often, smaller data blocks are compressed, making the process more efficient."

Temperature sensitive storage efficiency was introduced in ONTAP 9.8 and is enabled automatically on newly created thin-provisioned AFF volumes. With this feature, storage efficiency is applied according to whether data is hot or cold. For cold data, larger data blocks are compressed, and for hot data, which is overwritten more often, smaller data blocks are compressed, making the process more efficient.

[NOTE]
====
On FabricPool-enabled aggregates, temperature sensitive storage efficiency is disabled by default to avoid causing lower storage efficiency on the capacity tier.
