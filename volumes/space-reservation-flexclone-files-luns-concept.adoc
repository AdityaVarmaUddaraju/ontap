FlexClone files and FlexClone LUNs inherit the space reservation attribute from the parent file and parent LUN by default. However, you can create FlexClone files and FlexClone LUNs with space reservation disabled from a parent file and parent LUN with space reservation enabled if the FlexVol volume lacks space.

If the FlexVol volume does not contain enough space to create a FlexClone file or FlexClone LUN with the same space reservation as that of the parent, then the cloning operation fails.
