You can stop a deduplication or postprocess compression operation by using the `volume efficiency stop` command. This command automatically generates a checkpoint.

.Step

. Use the `volume efficiency stop` command to stop an active deduplication or postprocess compression operation.
+
If you specify the `-all` option, active and queued efficiency operations are aborted.

.Examples

The following command stops the deduplication or postprocess compression operation that is currently active on volume VolA:

`volume efficiency stop -vserver vs1 -volume VolA`

The following command aborts both active and queued deduplication or postprocess compression operations on volume VolA:

`volume efficiency stop -vserver vs1 -volume VolA -all true`
