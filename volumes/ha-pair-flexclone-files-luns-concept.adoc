[.lead]
FlexClone file and FlexClone LUN operations are supported in an HA configuration.

In an HA pair, you cannot create FlexClone files or FlexClone LUNs on the partner while the takeover or giveback operation is in progress. All the pending block sharing operations on the partner are resumed after the takeover or giveback operation is complete.
