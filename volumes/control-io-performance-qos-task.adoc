You can control input/output (I/O) performance to FlexVol volumes by assigning volumes to Storage QoS policy groups. You might control I/O performance to ensure that workloads achieve specific performance objectives or to throttle a workload that negatively impacts other workloads.

.About this task

Policy groups enforce a maximum throughput limit (for example, 100 MB/s). You can create a policy group without specifying a maximum throughput, which enables you to monitor performance before you control the workload.

You can also assign SVMs, LUNs, and files to policy groups.

Note the following requirements about assigning a volume to a policy group:

* The volume must be contained by the SVM to which the policy group belongs.
+
You specify the SVM when you create the policy group.

* If you assign a volume to a policy group, then you cannot assign the volume's containing SVM or any child LUNs or files to a policy group.

For more information about how to use Storage QoS, see the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/system-admin/index.html[System Administration Reference].

.Steps

. Use the `qos policy-group create` command to create a policy group.
. Use the `volume create` command or the `volume modify` command with the `-qos-policy-group` parameter to assign a volume to a policy group.
. Use the `qos statistics` commands to view performance data.
. If necessary, use the `qos policy-group modify` command to adjust the policy group's maximum throughput limit.
