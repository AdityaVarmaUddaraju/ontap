You can use explicit quotas to specify a quota for a specific quota target, or to override a default quota for a specific target.

An explicit quota specifies a limit for a particular user, group, or qtree. An explicit quota replaces any default quota that is in place for the same target.

When you add an explicit user quota for a user that has a derived user quota, you must use the same user mapping setting as the default user quota. Otherwise, when you resize quotas, the explicit user quota is rejected because it is considered a new quota.

Explicit quotas only affect default quotas at the same level (volume or qtree). For example, an explicit user quota for a qtree does not affect the default user quota for the volume that contains that qtree. However, the explicit user quota for the qtree overrides (replaces the limits defined by) the default user quota for that qtree.

.Examples of explicit quotas

The following quotas file contains a default user quota that limits all users in vol1 to 50 MB of space. However, one user, jsmith, is allowed 80 MB of space, because of the explicit quota (shown in bold):

----
#Quota target type            disk  files  thold  sdisk  sfile
#-----------  ----            ----  -----  -----  -----  -----
*             user@/vol/vol1  50M
**jsmith      user@/vol/vol1  80M**
----

The following quotas entry restricts the specified user, represented by four IDs, to 500MB of disk space and 10,240 files in the vol1 volume:

The following quotas entry restricts the eng1 group to 150 MB of disk space and an unlimited number of files in the /vol/vol2/proj1 qtree:

----
eng1        group@/vol/vol2/proj1  150M
----

The following quotas entry restricts the proj1 qtree in the vol2 volume to 750 MB of disk space and 76,800 files:

----
/vol/vol2/proj1   tree                750M      75K
