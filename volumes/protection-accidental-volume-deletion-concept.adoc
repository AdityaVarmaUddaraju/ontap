Default volume delete behavior aids the recovery of accidentally deleted FlexVol volumes.

A `volume delete` request against a volume that has type `RW` or `DP` (as seen in `volume show` command output) causes that volume to be moved to a partially deleted state. By default, it is retained in a recovery queue for at least 12 hours before being fully deleted.
