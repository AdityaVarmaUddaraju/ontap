[.lead]
When you rename a qtree using ONTAP, the quota rules for that qtree are automatically updated. If you rename a qtree using your CIFS or NFS client, you must update any quota rules for that qtree.

[NOTE]
====
If you rename a qtree using your CIFS or NFS client and do not update quota rules for that qtree with the new name before you reinitialize quotas, quotas will not be applied to the qtree and explicit quotas for the qtree--including tree quotas and user or group quotas for the qtree--might be converted into derived quotas.
