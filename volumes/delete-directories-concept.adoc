Beginning in ONTAP 9.8, you can delete large directories with lower latencies. This improved method of directory delete can be implemented through a new REST API or using the ONTAP command line interface (CLI).

Starting with ONTAP 9.9.1, you can also use ONTAP System Manager to perform a fast directory delete. For more information, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/task_nas_file_system_analytics_take_corrective_action.html[Take corrective action based on analytics].
