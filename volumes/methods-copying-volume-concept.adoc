Copying a volume creates a stand-alone copy of a volume that you can use for testing and other purposes. The method you use to copy a volume depends on the use case.

The method you use for copying a volume depends on whether you are copying it to the same aggregate or a different aggregate, and whether you want to retain Snapshot copies from the original volume. The following table lists characteristics of the copy and the methods used to create that copy.
