If a default user quota is defined for a FlexVol volume, a default user quota is automatically created for every qtree contained by that volume for which an explicit or derived tree quota exists.

If a default user quota on the qtree already exists, it remains unaffected when the default user quota on the volume is created.

The automatically created default user quotas on the qtrees have the same limits as the default user quota you create for the volume.

An explicit user quota for a qtree overrides (replaces the limits applied by) the automatically created default user quota, the same way as it overrides a default user quota on that qtree that was created by an administrator.
