It is recommended that you use the REST API to delete your directory. You can also use ONTAP command line interface (CLI) to delete your directory.

.Steps

. Enter advanced privilege mode:
+
`-privilege advance`
. Delete the directory:
+
`volume file async-delete start volume volume_name vserver vserver_name path directory_path -throttle throttle`
+
The minimum throttle value is 10, the maximum is 100,000, and the default is 5000.
+
The following example creates a new directory async delete job with the default throttle.

----
cluster-cli::*> volume file async-delete start -vserver vs1 -volume vol1 -path d1

`event log show`
