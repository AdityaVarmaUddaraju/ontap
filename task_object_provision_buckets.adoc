Add an S3 bucket for the new S3 object store or add additional buckets to an existing object store.

.Steps

.	Add a new bucket on an S3-enabled storage VM.
..	Click *Storage > Buckets*, then click *Add*.
..	Enter a name, select the S3-enabled storage VM, and enter a size.
+
* If you click *Save* at this point, a bucket is created with these default settings:

**	No users are granted access to the bucket except for the default SVM S3 user and any SVM policy groups in effect.
**	A Quality of Service (performance) level that is the highest available for your system.

*	You can click *More Options* to configure user permissions and performance level when you configure the bucket, or you can modify these settings later.

**	If you intend to use the S3 object store for FabricPool tiering, consider selecting *Use for tiering* (use low-cost media with optimal performance for the tiered data) rather than a performance service level.

.	On S3 client apps – another ONTAP system or an external 3rd-party app – verify access to the new bucket by entering the following:

*	The S3 server FQDN name and bucket name.
*	The bucket’s key and certificate.
