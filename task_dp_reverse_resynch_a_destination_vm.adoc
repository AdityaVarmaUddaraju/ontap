Starting in System Manager 9.8, you can perform a reverse resynchronization operation to delete an existing protection relationship and reverse the functions of the source and destination volumes. Then you use the destination volume to serve data while you repair or replace the source, update the source, and reestablish the original configuration of the systems.

When you perform a reverse resynch operation, any data on the source volume that is newer than the data in the common Snapshot copy is deleted.

.Steps
.	Select the desired protection relationship: click *Protection > Relationships*.
.	Click image:icon_kabob.gif[kabob icon] and click *Reverse Resync*.
.	Under *Relationships*, monitor the reverse resynchronization progress by viewing *Transfer Status* for the relationship.
