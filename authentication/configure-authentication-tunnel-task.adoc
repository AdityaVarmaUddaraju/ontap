[.lead]
If you have already configured a CIFS server for a data SVM, you can use the `security login domain-tunnel create` command to configure the SVM as a gateway, or _tunnel_, for AD access to the cluster.

.What you'll need

* You must have configured a CIFS server for a data SVM.
* You must have enabled an AD domain user account to access the admin SVM for the cluster.
* You must be a cluster administrator to perform this task.

.Step

. Configure a CIFS-enabled data SVM as an authentication tunnel for AD domain controller access to the cluster:
+
`security login domain-tunnel create -vserver SVM_name`
+
For complete command syntax, see the link:config-worksheets-reference.html[worksheet].
+
[NOTE]
====
The SVM must be running for the user to be authenticated.
====
+
The following command configures the CIFS-enabled data SVM``engData`` as an authentication tunnel.
