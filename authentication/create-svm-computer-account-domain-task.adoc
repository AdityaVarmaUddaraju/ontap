If you have not configured a CIFS server for a data SVM, you can use the `vserver active-directory create` command to create a computer account for the SVM on the domain.

.What you'll need

You must be a cluster or SVM administrator to perform this task.

.About this task

After you enter the `vserver active-directory create` command, you are prompted to provide the credentials for an AD user account with sufficient privileges to add computers to the specified organizational unit in the domain. The password of the account cannot be empty.

+
`vserver active-directory create -vserver SVM_name -account-name NetBIOS_account_name -domain domain -ou organizational_unit`

For complete command syntax, see the link:config-worksheets-reference.html[worksheet].
