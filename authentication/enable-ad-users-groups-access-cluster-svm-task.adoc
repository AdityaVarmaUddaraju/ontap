summary: "You must configure AD domain controller access to the cluster or SVM before an AD account can access the SVM. If you have already configured a CIFS server for a data SVM, you can configure the SVM as a gateway, or tunnel, for AD access to the cluster. If you have not configured a CIFS server, you can create a computer account for the SVM on the AD domain."

You must configure AD domain controller access to the cluster or SVM before an AD account can access the SVM. If you have already configured a CIFS server for a data SVM, you can configure the SVM as a gateway, or _tunnel_, for AD access to the cluster. If you have not configured a CIFS server, you can create a computer account for the SVM on the AD domain.
