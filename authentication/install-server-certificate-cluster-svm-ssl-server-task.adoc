On production systems, it is a best practice to install a CA-signed digital certificate for use in authenticating the cluster or SVM as an SSL server. You can use the `security certificate generate-csr` command to generate a certificate signing request (CSR), and the `security certificate install` command to install the certificate you receive back from the certificate authority.
