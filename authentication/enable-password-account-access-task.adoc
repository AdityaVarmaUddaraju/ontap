You can use the `security login create` command to enable administrator accounts to access an admin or data SVM with a password. You are prompted for the password after you enter the command.

.What you'll need

You must be a cluster administrator to perform this task.

.About this task

If you are unsure of the access control role that you want to assign to the login account, you can use the `security login modify` command to add the role later.

.Step

. Enable local administrator accounts to access an SVM using a password:
+
`security login create -vserver SVM_name -user-or-group-name user_or_group_name -application application -authmethod authentication_method -role role -comment comment`
+
For complete command syntax, see the link:config-worksheets-reference.html[worksheet].
+
The following command enables the cluster administrator account `admin1` with the predefined `backup` role to access the admin SVM``engCluster`` using a password. You are prompted for the password after you enter the command.
