This content describes how to enable login accounts for cluster administrators and storage virtual machine (SVM) administrators, and how to use role-based access control (RBAC) to define the capabilities of administrators.

You should use this content if you want to enable login accounts and RBAC in the following way:

* You want to use the ONTAP command-line interface (CLI), not System Manager or an automated scripting tool.
* You want to use best practices, not explore every available option.
* You do not want to read a lot of conceptual background.
* You are not using SNMP to collect information about the cluster.

If this content is not suitable for your situation, you should see the following documentation instead:
