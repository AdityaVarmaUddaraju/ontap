You can search for various actions and objects in System Manager. Then, you can sort and filter the results.

.NOTE
For better results, perform searching, filtering, and sorting one minute after logging in and five minutes after creating, modifying, or deleting an object.

== Searching

At the top of each page in System Manager, you can use a global search field to search various objects and actions in the interface. For example, you can search for different objects by name, pages available in the navigator column (on the left side), various action items, like "Add Volume" or "Add License", and links to external help topics.

The search is not case-sensitive.   You can enter a variety of text strings to find the page, actions, or topics you need.  Up to 20 results are listed.  If more results are found, you can click *Show more* to view all results.   The following examples describe typical searches:

[cols=3,options="header"]
