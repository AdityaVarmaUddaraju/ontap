When you update the ONTAP software, you must use a different procedure depending on whether you are upgrading, downgrading, or reverting the software.

An ONTAP software update involves one of the following possible activities.

* *Software upgrade*
+
The software version is changed from an earlier version to a later version of ONTAP. For example, from ONTAP 9.7 to ONTAP 9.8.

* *Software revert*
+
The software version is changed from a later version to an earlier version of ONTAP. For example, from ONTAP 9.8 to ONTAP 9.7. Verify your cluster requirements to determine if you need to downgrade or revert.

* *Software downgrade*
+
The software version is changed from a later version to an earlier version of ONTAP within the same major release. For example, from ONTAP 9.3.2 to ONTAP 9.3.1. The only exception to this rule is the change from ONTAP 9.1 to ONTAP 9, which also follows the downgrade process. Verify your cluster requirements to determine if you need to downgrade or revert.
