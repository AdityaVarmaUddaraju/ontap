In some cases, to transition a cluster to an earlier ONTAP release, you must perform a _reversion_. Reverting is always disruptive, and it requires planning, preparation, the reversion itself, and several post-reversion procedures.

IMPORTANT: Do not attempt to revert ONTAP by simply downloading and booting (or netbooting) in an earlier release. If you do, you cannot boot the earlier target release. You must use the clustershell system node revert-to and nodeshell revert_to commands for the reversion process.
