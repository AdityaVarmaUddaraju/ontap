Before downgrading a storage system that uses array LUNs to an earlier release of ONTAP, you need to run the storage errors show command to determine whether there are any back-end configuration errors.

. Check for errors that would prevent ONTAP and the back-end storage array from operating together properly: `storage array config show`
 ** If the output _does not_ instruct you to run the storage errors show command, there are no errors and you can proceed with the downgrade.
 ** If the output _does_ instruct you to run the storage errors show command, continue with this procedure.
. Obtain details about the error at the array LUN level: `storage errors show`
