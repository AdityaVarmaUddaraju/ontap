The rolling upgrade method enables you to update a cluster of two or more nodes nondisruptively. This method has several steps: initiating a failover operation on each node in an HA pair, updating the "`failed`" node, initiating giveback, and then repeating the process for each HA pair in the cluster.

You must have satisfied upgrade or downgrade preparation requirements. Before you begin, you should launch Active IQ Digital Advisor. The Upgrade Advisor component of Active IQ Digital Advisor helps you plan for a successful update.

The versions used in these task examples might vary depending on whether you are upgrading or downgrading the software version, or if you are performing a major or minor upgrade or downgrade.
