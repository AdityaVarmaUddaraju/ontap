For the nondisruptive upgrade or downgrade of some MetroCluster configurations, you must use the manual procedure. The procedure used depends on the number of nodes in the MetroCluster configuration and the ONTAP version. The procedures apply to both MetroCluster FC and MetroCluster IP configurations.
