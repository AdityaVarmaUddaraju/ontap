If the SP automatic update functionality is enabled (the default), downgrading or reverting to ONTAP 8.3.x does not require a manual SP firmware update. The SP firmware is automatically updated to the newest compatible version that is supported by the ONTAP version you reverted or downgraded to.

If the SP automatic update functionality is disabled (not recommended), after the ONTAP revert or downgrade process is complete, you must manually update the SP firmware to a version that is supported for the ONTAP version you reverted or downgraded to.
