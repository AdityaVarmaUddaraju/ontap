Before reverting ONTAP, you should review resources to understand issues you must resolve before upgrading, understand new system behavior in the target release, and confirm hardware support.

. Review the _Release Notes_ for the target release.

+
The "`Important cautions`" section describes potential issues that you should be aware of before upgrading to the new release. The "`New and changed features`" and "`Known problems and limitations`" sections describe new system behavior after upgrading to the new release.

. Confirm that your hardware platform is supported in the target release.

. Confirm that your cluster and management switches are supported in the target release.
+
You must verify that the NX-OS (cluster network switches), IOS (management network switches), and reference configuration file (RCF) software versions are compatible with the version of ONTAP to which you are reverting.

. If your cluster is configured for SAN, confirm that the SAN configuration is fully supported.

All SAN components--including target ONTAP software version, host OS and patches, required Host Utilities software, and adapter drivers and firmware--should be supported.
