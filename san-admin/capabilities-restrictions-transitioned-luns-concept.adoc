LUNs that have been transitioned from Data ONTAP operating in 7-Mode to ONTAP have certain capabilities and restrictions that affect the way the LUNs can be managed.

You can do the following with transitioned LUNs:

* View the LUN using the `lun show` command
* View the inventory of LUNs transitioned from the 7-Mode volume using the `transition 7-mode show` command
* Restore a volume from a 7-Mode Snapshot copy
+
Restoring the volume transitions all of the LUNs captured in the Snapshot copy

* Restore a single LUN from a 7-Mode Snapshot copy using the `snapshot restore-file` command
* Create a clone of a LUN in a 7-Mode Snapshot copy
* Restore a range of blocks from a LUN captured in a 7-Mode Snapshot copy
* Create a FlexClone of the volume using a 7-Mode Snapshot copy

You cannot do the following with transitioned LUNs:

* Access Snapshot copy-backed LUN clones captured in the volume
