[.lead]
To achieve I/O alignment with your OS partitioning scheme, you should use the recommended ONTAP LUN `ostype` value that most closely matches your operating system.

The partition scheme employed by the host operating system is a major contributing factor to I/O misalignments. Some ONTAP LUN `ostype` values use a special offset known as a "`prefix`" to enable the default partitioning scheme used by the host operating system to be aligned.

[NOTE]
====
In some circumstances, a custom partitioning table might be required to achieve I/O alignment. However, for `ostype` values with a "`prefix`" value greater than `0`, a custom partition might create misaligned I/O.
====

The LUN `ostype` values in the following table should be used based on your operating system.
