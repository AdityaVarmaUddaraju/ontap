You can move a LUN across volumes within a storage virtual machine (SVM), but you cannot move a LUN across SVMs. LUNs moved across volumes within an SVM are moved immediately and without loss of connectivity.

.What you'll need

If your LUN is using Selective LUN Map (SLM), the SLM reporting nodes must have been modified to include the destination node and its HA partner.

.About this task

Storage efficiency features, such as deduplication, compression, and compaction are not preserved during a LUN move. They must be reapplied after the LUN move is completed.

Data protection through Snapshot copies occurs at the volume level. Therefore, when you move a LUN, it falls under the data protection scheme of the destination volume. If you do not have Snapshot copies established for the destination volume, Snapshot copies of the LUN are not created. Also, all of the Snapshot copies of the LUN stay in the original volume until those Snapshot copies are deleted.

You cannot move a LUN to the following volumes:

* A SnapMirror destination volume
* The SVM root volume

You cannot move the following types of LUNs:

* A LUN that has been created from a file
* A LUN that is in NVFail state
* A LUN that is in a load-sharing relationship
* A protocol-endpoint class LUN

[NOTE]
====
For Solaris os_type LUNs that are 1 TB or larger, the host might experience a timeout during the LUN move. For this LUN type, you should unmount the LUN before initiating the move.
====

.Steps

. Move the LUN by using the `lun move start` command.
+
During a very brief period, the LUN is visible on both the origin and destination volume. This is expected and is resolved upon completion of the move.

. Track the status of the move and verify successful completion by using the `lun move show` command.
