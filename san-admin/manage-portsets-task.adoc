In addition to xref:selective-lun-map-concept.adoc[Selective LUN Map (SLM)], you can use portsets to further limit which LIFs can be used by an initiator to access a LUN.

Starting with ONTAP 9.10.1, you can use System Manager to create portsets and bind them to igroups. You can also use System Manager to change the network interfaces associated with portsets and to delete portsets.


== Create a portset and bind to an igroup

If you do not bind a port set to an igroup, then all of the initiators in the igroup can access mapped LUNs through all of the LIFs on the node owning the LUN and the owning nodeâ€™s HA partner.

If you need to create a portset and bind it to an igroup in an ONTAP release earlier than 9.10.1 you must use the xref:create-port-sets-binding-igroups-task.adoc[ONTAP CLI procedure].

.	In ONTAP System Manager, click *Network > Overview > Portsets*, and click *Add*.
.	Enter the information for the new portset and click *Add*.
.	Click *Hosts > SAN Initiator Groups*.
.	To bind the portset to a new igroup, click *Add*.
+
To bind the portset to an existing igroup, select the igroup, click image:icon_kabob.gif[Kabob icon], and then click *Edit Initiator Group*.

== Change network interfaces associated with a portset

.	In ONTAP System Manager, click *Network > Overview > Portsets*.
.	Select the portset you want to edit and click image:icon_kabob.gif[Kabob icon], then select *Edit Portset*.

== Delete a portset

.	In ONTAP System Manager, click *Network > Overview > Portsets*.
.	To delete a single portset, select the portset, click image:icon_kabob.gif[] and then select *Delete Portsets*.
+
To delete multiple portsets, select the portsets, and click *Delete*.
