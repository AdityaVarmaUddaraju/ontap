[.lead]
You must be aware of certain LIF considerations in a SAN environment.

* Initiators must use Multipath I/O (MPIO) and asymmetric logical unit access(ALUA) for failover capability for clusters in a SAN iSCSI or FC environment because SAN does not support automatic failover for LIFs.
* At least one SAN LIF of the appropriate protocol must be configured on each node that hosts a mapped LUN and the node's HA partner.
+
You can configure two LIFs per node, one for each fabric being used with FC and to separate Ethernet networks for iSCSI.

* Some options are not applicable for iSCSI or FC.
+
For example, you cannot use IP addresses with FC.
