The LUN must be unmapped from its igroup before you can delete it.

.Steps

. Verify that the application or host is not using the LUN.
. Unmap the LUN from the igroup:
+
`lun mapping delete`
+
`lun mapping delete -vserver vs5 -volume vo5 -lun lun5 -igroup igr5`

. Delete the LUN:
+
`lun delete`
+
`lun delete -vserver vs5 -volume vol5 -lun lun5`

. Verify that you deleted the LUN:
+
`lun show`
+
`lun show -vserver vs5`
+
