summary: "LUNs used as ESX boot LUNs are typically reported by ONTAP as misaligned. ESX creates multiple partitions on the boot LUN, making it very difficult to align. Misaligned ESX boot LUNs are not typically a performance problem because the total amount of misaligned I/O is small. Assuming that the LUN was correctly provisioned with the VMwareostype, no action is needed."

LUNs used as ESX boot LUNs are typically reported by ONTAP as misaligned. ESX creates multiple partitions on the boot LUN, making it very difficult to align. Misaligned ESX boot LUNs are not typically a performance problem because the total amount of misaligned I/O is small. Assuming that the LUN was correctly provisioned with the VMware `ostype`, no action is needed.
