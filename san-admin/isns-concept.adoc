[.lead]
The Internet Storage Name Service (iSNS) is a protocol that enables automated discovery and management of iSCSI devices on a TCP/IP storage network. An iSNS server maintains information about active iSCSI devices on the network, including their IP addresses, iSCSI node names IQN's, and portal groups.

You can obtain an iSNS server from a third-party vendor. If you have an iSNS server on your network configured and enabled for use by the initiator and target, you can use the management LIF for a storage virtual machine (SVM) to register all the iSCSI LIFs for that SVM on the iSNS server. After the registration is complete, the iSCSI initiator can query the iSNS server to discover all the LIFs for that particular SVM.

If you decide to use an iSNS service, you must ensure that your storage virtual machines (SVMs) are properly registered with an Internet Storage Name Service (iSNS) server.

If you do not have an iSNS server on your network, you must manually configure each target to be visible to the host.

== What an iSNS server does

An iSNS server uses the Internet Storage Name Service (iSNS) protocol to maintain information about active iSCSI devices on the network, including their IP addresses, iSCSI node names (IQNs), and portal groups.

The iSNS protocol enables automated discovery and management of iSCSI devices on an IP storage network. An iSCSI initiator can query the iSNS server to discover iSCSI target devices.

NetApp does not supply or resell iSNS servers. You can obtain these servers from a vendor supported by NetApp.
