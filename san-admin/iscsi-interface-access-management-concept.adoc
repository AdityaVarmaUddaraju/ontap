ISCSI interface access lists can be used to limit the number of LIFs in an SVM that an initiator can access, thereby increasing performance and security.

When an initiator begins a discovery session using an iSCSI `SendTargets` command, it receives the IP addresses associated with the LIF (network interface) that is in the access list. By default, all initiators have access to all iSCSI LIFs in the SVM. You can use the access list to restrict the number of LIFs in an SVM that an initiator has access to.
