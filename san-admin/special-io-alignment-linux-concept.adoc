Linux distributions offer a wide variety of ways to use a LUN including as raw devices for databases, various volume managers, and file systems. It is not necessary to create partitions on a LUN when used as a raw device or as physical volume in a logical volume.

For RHEL 5 and earlier and SLES 10 and earlier, if the LUN will be used without a volume manager, you should partition the LUN to have one partition that begins at an aligned offset, which is a sector that is an even multiple of eight logical blocks.
