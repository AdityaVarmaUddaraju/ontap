Beginning with ONTAP 9.4 the NVMe/FC protocol is supported. Before you can use the NVMe/FC protocol on your storage virtual machine (SVM), you must start the NVMe/FC service on the SVM.

.What you'll need

NVMe/FC must be allowed as a protocol on your system.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.4, NVMe is allowed by default.

.Steps

. Change the privilege setting to advanced:
+
`set -privilege advanced`
. Verify that NVMe is allowed as a protocol:
+
`vserver nvme show`
. Create the NVMe protocol service:
+
`vserver nvme create`
. Start the NVMe protocol service on the SVM:
+
`vserver nvme modify -status -admin up`
