You can manage the availability of the iSCSI service on the iSCSI logical interfaces of the storage virtual machine (SVM) by using the `vserver iscsi interface enable` or `vserver iscsi interface disable` commands.

By default, the iSCSI service is enabled on all iSCSI logical interfaces.

== How iSCSI is implemented on the host

iSCSI can be implemented on the host using hardware or software.

You can implement iSCSI in one of the following ways:

* Using Initiator software that uses the host's standard Ethernet interfaces.
* Through an iSCSI host bus adapter (HBA): An iSCSI HBA appears to the host operating system as a SCSI disk adapter with local disks.
* Using a TCP Offload Engine (TOE) adapter that offloads TCP/IP processing.
+
The iSCSI protocol processing is still performed by host software.
