If your environment has a combination of LUNs created in ONTAP and LUNs transitioned from previous versions, you might need to determine whether Selective LUN Map (SLM) is enabled on a specific LUN.

You can use the information displayed in the output of the `lun mapping show -fields reporting-nodes, node` command to determine whether SLM is enabled on your LUN map. If SLM is not enabled, "-" is displayed in the cells under the `reporting-nodes` column of the command output. If SLM is enabled, the list of nodes displayed under the `nodes` column is duplicated in the `reporting-nodes` column.
