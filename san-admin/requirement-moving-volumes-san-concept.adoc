[.lead]
Before you move a volume that contains LUNs or namespaces, you must meet certain requirements.

* For volumes containing one or more LUNs, you should have a minimum of two paths per LUN (LIFs) connecting to each node in the cluster.
+
This eliminates single points of failure and enables the system to survive component failures.

* For volumes containing namespaces, the cluster must be running ONTAP 9.6 or later.
+
Volume move is not supported for NVMe configurations running ONTAP 9.5.
