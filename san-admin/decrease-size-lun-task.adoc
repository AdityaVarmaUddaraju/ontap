Before you decrease the size of a LUN, the host needs to migrate the blocks containing the LUN data into the boundary of the smaller LUN size. You should use a tool such as SnapDrive for Windows to ensure that the LUN is properly decreased without truncating blocks containing LUN data. Manually decreasing the size of your LUN is not recommended.

.About this task

After you decrease the size of your LUN, ONTAP automatically notifies the initiator that the LUN size has decreased. However, additional steps might be required on your host for the host to recognize the new LUN size. Check your host documentation for specific information about decreasing the size of the host file structure.
