Modify storage VMs to enable SMB servers for serving data to Windows clients.

This procedure enables an existing storage VM. It assumes that configuration details are available for any authentication or security services required in your environment.

//Question: Is it necessary to create a new export policy for the root volume, or should we modify the default policy?

.Steps

. Enable SMB on an existing VM: click *Storage > Storage VMs*, select a storage VM, click *Settings*, and then click image:icon_gear.gif[settings icon] in the SMB/CIFS tile.

. Open the export policy of the storage VM root volume:

.. Click *Storage > Volumes*, select the root volume of the storage VM (which by default is _volume-name_root_), and then click on the policy that is displayed under *Export Policy*.

.. Click *Add* to add a rule.

*** Client specification = `0.0.0.0/0`

*** Access protocols = SMB/CIFS

*** Access details = NTFS Read-Only

. Configure DNS for host-name resolution:

.. Click *Storage > Storage VMs*, select the storage VM, click *Settings*, and then click image:icon_gear.gif[settings icon] in the DNS tile.

.. Switch to the DNS server and map the SMB server.
You should have administrative access to your site's DNS server. If you do not have administrative access, ask the DNS administrator to perform this task.

*** Create forward (A - Address record) and reverse (PTR - Pointer record) lookup entries to map the SMB server name to the IP address of the data LIF.

*** If you use NetBIOS aliases, create an Alias canonical name (CNAME resource record) lookup entry to map each alias to the IP address of the SMB server's data LIF.

. Configure name services as required

.. Click *Storage > Storage VMs*, select the storage VM, click *Settings*, and then click image:icon_gear.gif[settings icon] in the LDAP or NIS tile.

.. Include any changes in the name services switch file: click image:icon_pencil.gif[edit icon]in the Name Services Switch tile.

. Configure Kerberos if required:

.. Click *Storage > Storage VMs*, select the storage VM, and then click *Settings*.

.. Click image:icon_arrow.gif[arrow icon] in the Kerberos tile and then click *Add*.
