Create volumes to provide storage for Linux servers using the NFS protocol.

This procedure creates new volumes on an link:task_nas_enable_linux_nfs.html[existing NFS-enabled storage VM].

.Steps

. Create a new volume: click *Storage > Volumes* and then click *Add*.

.. The default export policy grants full access to all users. You can add more restrictive rules to the export policy later.

. Switch to a Linux system to verify access.

.. Create and mount the volume using the LIF of the storage VM.

.. On the newly mounted volume, create a test file, write text to it, and then delete the file.

After verifying access, you might want to link:task_nas_provision_export_policies.html[restrict client access with the volumeâ€™s export policy] and set any desired UNIX ownership and permissions on the mounted volume.
