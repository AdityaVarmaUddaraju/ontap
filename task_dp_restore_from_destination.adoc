When your original source volume is available again after a disaster, you can restore data from the destination volume and reestablish the protection relationship.

This procedure restores the original source volume in an asynchronous relationship so that you can start serving data from that volume again and resume the original protection relationship.

.Steps

. Click *Protection > Relationships* and then click the relationship you want to restore.

. Click image:icon_kabob.gif[alt=Menu Options] and then select *Restore*.

. The source volume is selected by default. Click *Other Volume* if you want to choose a different volume.

. Under *Relationships* on the restore destination cluster, monitor the restore progress by checking the relationship state.
