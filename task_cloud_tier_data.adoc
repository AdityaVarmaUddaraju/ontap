Storing data in tiers can enhance the efficiency of your storage system. You can manage storage tiers by using FabricPool to store data in a tier, based on how frequently the data is accessed.

This procedure sets up an object store as the cloud tier for FabricPool. Keep in mind that once you attach to a local tier (aggregate) the cloud tier cannot be unattached.

A FabricPool license is not required if you are tiering to ONTAP S3 but is required for other cloud tier locations.

You will need to use the CLI to set a volume tiering policy and to start tiering.

.Steps

. Click *Storage > Tiers > Add Cloud Tier* and select the object store provider you want to use.

. If you want to create a cloud mirror, click *Add as Primary*.
