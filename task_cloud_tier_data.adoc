Storing data in tiers can enhance the efficiency of your storage system. You can manage storage tiers by using FabricPool to store data in a tier, based on how frequently the data is accessed.

This procedure sets up an object store as the cloud tier for FabricPool. Keep in mind that once you attach to a local tier (aggr) the cloud tier cannot be unattached.

A FabricPool license is not required when using StorageGRID or ONTAP S3 as the cloud tier or when using Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Microsoft Azure Blob Storage as the cloud tier for Cloud Volumes for ONTAP. A FabricPool license is required for other cloud tier locations.

You also have the option to create a volume tiering policy in System Manager.

.Steps

. Click *Storage > Tiers > Add Cloud Tier* and select the object store provider you want to use.

. If you want to create a cloud mirror, click *Add as FabricPool Mirror*.
