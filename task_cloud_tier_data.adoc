Storing data in tiers can enhance the efficiency of your storage system. You can manage storage tiers by using FabricPool to store data in a tier, based on how frequently the data is accessed.

This procedure sets up an object store as the cloud tier for FabricPool.

Steps:

. Click *Storage > Tiers> Add Cloud Tier* and select the object store provider you want to use.

. If you want to create a cloud mirror, click *Add as Primary*.
