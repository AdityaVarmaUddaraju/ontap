Before you create a new S3 bucket, you must decide whether to place it in a new or existing SVM. This decision determines your workflow.

.Choices

* If you want to provision a bucket in a new SVM or an SVM that is not enabled for S3, complete the steps in the following topics.

Although S3 can coexist in an SVM with NFS and SMB/CIFS, you might choose to create a new SVM if one of the following is true:

 ** You are enabling S3 on a cluster for the first time.
 ** You have existing SVMs in a cluster in which you do not want to enable S3 support.
 ** You have one or more S3-enabled-SVMs in a cluster, and you want another S3 server with different performance characteristics.
After enabling S3 on the SVM, proceed to provision a bucket.

* If you want to provision the initial bucket or an additional bucket on an existing S3-enabled SVM, complete the steps in the following topic.
