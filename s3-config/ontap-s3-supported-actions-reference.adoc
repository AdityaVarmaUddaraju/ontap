== Object operations

Beginning with ONTAP 9.9.1, ONTAP S3 supports object metadata and tagging.

* PutObject and CreateMultipartUpload now include key-value pairs using `x-amz-meta-<key>.`
+
For example: `x-amz-meta-project: ontap_s3`.

 ** PutObjectTagging
 ** GetObjectTagging
 ** DeleteObjectTagging

Supported object actions:

* PutObject
* PutObjectTagging (beginning with ONTAP 9.9.1)
* GetObject
