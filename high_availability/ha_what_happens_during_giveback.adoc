The local node returns ownership to the partner node when issues are resolved, when the partner node boots up, or when giveback is initiated.

The following process takes place in a normal giveback operation. In this discussion, Node A has taken over Node B. Any issues on Node B have been resolved and it is ready to resume serving data.

. Any issues on Node B are resolved and it displays the following message: `Waiting for giveback`
. The giveback is initiated by the `storage failover giveback` command or by automatic giveback if the system is configured for it. This initiates the process of returning ownership of Node B's aggregates and volumes from Node A back to Node B.
. Node A returns control of the root aggregate first.
. Node B completes the process of booting up to its normal operating state.
. As soon as Node B reaches the point in the boot process where it can accept the non-root aggregates, Node A returns ownership of the other aggregates, one at a time, until giveback is complete. You can monitor the progress of the giveback with the `storage failover show-giveback` command.

[NOTE]
The `storage failover show-giveback` command does not (nor is it intended to) display information about all operations occurring during the storage failover giveback operation. You can use the `storage failover show` command to display additional details about the current failover status of the node, such as if the node is fully functional, takeover is possible, and giveback is complete.

I/O resumes for each aggregate once giveback is complete for that aggregate, which reduces its overall outage window.
