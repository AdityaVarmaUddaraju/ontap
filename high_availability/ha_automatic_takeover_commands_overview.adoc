Automatic takeover is enabled by default on all supported NetApp FAS, AFF, and ASA platforms. 

In certain situations, you might need to change the default behavior and control when automatic takeovers occur. <Table 2> illustrates this information.

=== Enable email notification if the takeover capability is disabled

To receive prompt notification if the takeover capability becomes disabled, you should configure your system to enable automatic email notification for the `takeover impossible` EMS messages:

* `ha.takeoverImpVersion`
* `ha.takeoverImpLowMem`
* `ha.takeoverImpDegraded`
* `ha.takeoverImpUnsync`
* `ha.takeoverImpIC`
* `ha.takeoverImpHotShelf`
* `ha.takeoverImpNotDef`
