QUESTION: We should assume storage failover is enabled, yes? If so, aren’t these system events mostly covered at the very start of this document?

Some events lead to an automatic takeover if storage failover is enabled.

The following system events cause an automatic and unavoidable takeover of the node.

•The node cannot send heartbeat messages to its partner due to events such as loss of power or watchdog reset.

•You halt the node without using the `-f` or `-inhibit-takeover` parameter.

If the `onpanic` parameter is set to `true`, a node panic also causes an automatic takeover. If `onpanic` is set to `false` a node panic does not cause an automatic takeover.
