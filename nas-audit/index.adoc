This content describes the file access auditing features available for the SMB/CIFS and NFS protocols with ONTAP: native auditing and file policy management using FPolicy. It includes a conceptual overview, planning guidance, and detailed implementation instructions.

*You should use this content* if you want to design and implement auditing of SMB/CIFS and NFS file access events under the following circumstances:

* Basic SMB/CIFS and NFS protocol file access has been configured.
* You want to create and maintain an auditing configuration using one of the following methods:
 ** Native ONTAP functionality
 ** External FPolicy servers

*If you want to create a basic configuration using best practices*, and you do not want a lot of conceptual background, you should choose among the following documentation:

* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-sm-classic/smb-config/index.html[SMB configuration] - basic configuration using ONTAP System Manager

* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-sm-classic/nas-multiprotocol-config/index.html[SMB and NFS multiprotocol configuration] - basic configuration using ONTAP System Manager
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-sm-classic/nfs-config/index.html[NFS configuration with System Managaer] - basic configuration using ONTAP System Manager

* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/nfs-config/index.html[NFS configuration] - advanced configuration using the CLI

*If you want general information* about SMB/CIFS and NFS protocol support in ONTAP, you should choose among the following documentation:

* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/smb-admin/index.html[SMB/CIFS management]
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/nfs-admin/index.html[NFS management]

*If you require additional configuration or conceptual information*, you should choose among the following documentation:

* Auditing considerations for FlexCache relationships
 ** https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/flexcache/index.html[FlexCache volumes management]
* Networking concepts and detailed implementation procedures
 ** https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/networking/index.html[Network management]
* Hyper-V and SQL Server configuration and management over the SMB protocol
 ** https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/smb-hyper-v-sql/index.html[SMB/CIFS configuration for Microsoft Hyper-V and SQL Server]
