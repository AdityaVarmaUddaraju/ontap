[.lead]
ONTAP uses the combination of the IP address and the user credential configured in the FPolicy configuration to grant super user credentials to the FPolicy server.

Super user status grants the following privileges when the FPolicy server accesses data:

* Avoid permission checks
+
The user avoids checks on files and directory access.

* Special locking privileges
+
ONTAP allows read, write, or modify access to any file regardless of existing locks. If the FPolicy server takes byte range locks on the file, it results in immediate removal of existing locks on the file.

* Bypass any FPolicy checks
+
Access does not generate any FPolicy notifications.
