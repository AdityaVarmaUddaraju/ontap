NFS over RDMA provides a higher performance realization of NFSv4.0 utilizing RDMA adapters to allow memory to be copied directly from storage to the GPU, circumventing the CPU overhead.

NFS over RDMA configurations are designed for customers with GPU intensive workloads—such as AI and machine learning—who are using the NVIDIA GDX ecosystem. 

In ONTAP 9.10.1, this configuration is only supported for the NFSv4.0 protocol when used with the Mellanox CX-5 or CX-6 adapter, which provides support for RDMA using version 2 of the RoCE protocol.

.Requirements
* ONTAP version 9.10.1 or later
* Storage appliance configured with RDMA-supported hardware (e.g. Mellanox CX-5 or CX-6)
* NIC controllers must have RDMA support (currently A400, A700, and A800)
* Both the LIF and its HA pair must be upgraded to the same ONTAP version and be RDMA-capable
