Some ONTAP features are enabled by license keys. You can add license keys using ONTAP System Manager.

//Starting in ONTAP 9.9.1, you use System Manager to install a NetApp License File to enable multiple licensed features all at once. Using a NetApp License File simplifies license installation because you no longer have to add separate feature license keys. You download the NetApp License File from the NetApp Support Site.

//If you already have license keys for some features and you are upgrading to ONTAP 9.9.1, you can continue to use those license keys.
