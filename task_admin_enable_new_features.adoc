Starting in ONTAP 9.9.1, you use System Manager to install a NetApp License File to enable multiple licensed features all at once. Using a NetApp License File simplifies license installation because you no longer have to add separate feature license keys. You download the NetApp License File from the NetApp Support Site.

If you already have license keys for some features and you are upgrading to ONTAP 9.9.1, you can continue to use those license keys.
