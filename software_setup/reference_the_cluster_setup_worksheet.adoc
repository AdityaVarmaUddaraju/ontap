[.lead]
The cluster setup worksheet enables you to record the values that you need during the cluster setup process. If a default value is provided, you can use that value or else enter your own.

== System defaults (for clusters configured to use network switches)

The system defaults are the default values for the private cluster network. It is best to use these default values. However, if they do not meet your requirements, you can use the table to record your own values.

NOTE: Each cluster switch must use the 9000 MTU size.

You only need to consider the system defaults for clusters that are connected using network switches.

|Types of information| Your values

a|
Cluster name
The name must begin with a letter, and it must be fewer than 44 characters. The name can include the following special characters:

`.` `-` `_`

a|

a|
Cluster base license key
The cluster base license key is not required to complete setup. However, it must be installed before you can install any feature licenses.

To find your cluster base license key:

. Go to the NetApp Support Site.

http://mysupport.netapp.com[NetApp Support]

. Click *My Support* > *Software Licenses*.

a|
Cluster administrator password

The password for the admin account that the cluster requires before granting cluster administrator access to the console or through a secure protocol.

The default rules for passwords are as follows:

* A password must be at least eight characters long.
* A password must contain at least one letter and one number.

a|
Cluster management interface port

The physical port that is connected to the data network and enables the cluster administrator to manage the cluster.

a|

a|
Cluster management interface IP address

A unique IPv4 or IPv6 address for the cluster management interface. The cluster administrator uses this address to access the admin SVM and manage the cluster. Typically, this address should be on the data network.

You can obtain this IP address from the administrator responsible for assigning IP addresses in your organization.

Example: 192.0.2.66

a|

a|
Cluster management interface netmask (IPv4)

The subnet mask that defines the range of valid IPv4 addresses on the cluster management network.

Example: 255.255.255.0

a|

a|
Cluster management interface netmask length (IPv6)

If the cluster management interface uses an IPv6 address, then this value represents the prefix length that defines the range of valid IPv6 addresses on the cluster management network.

Example: 64

a|

a|
Cluster management interface default gateway

The IP address for the router on the cluster management network.

a|

a|
DNS domain name

The name of your network's DNS domain.

The domain name must consist of alphanumeric characters. To enter multiple DNS domain names, separate each name with either a comma or a space.

a|

a|
Name server IP addresses

The IP addresses of the DNS name servers. Separate each address with either a comma or a space.

a|

== Node information (for each node in the cluster)

[cols=2*,options="header"]
|===
|Types of information| Your values

a|
Physical location of the controller

A description of the physical location of the controller. Use a description that identifies where to find this node in the cluster (for example, "`Lab 5, Row 7, Rack B`").

a|

a|
Node management interface port

The physical port that is connected to the node management network and enables the cluster administrator to manage the node.

a|

a|
Node management interface IP addressA unique IPv4 or IPv6 address for the node management interface on the management network. If you defined the node management interface port to be a data port, then this IP address should be a unique IP address on the data network.

You can obtain this IP address from the administrator responsible for assigning IP addresses in your organization.

Example: 192.0.2.66

a|

a|
Node management interface netmask (IPv4)The subnet mask that defines the range of valid IP addresses on the node management network.

If you defined the node management interface port to be a data port, then the netmask should be the subnet mask for the data network.

Example: 255.255.255.0

a|

a|
Node management interface netmask length (IPv6)If the node management interface uses an IPv6 address, then this value represents the prefix length that defines the range of valid IPv6 addresses on the node management network.

Example: 64

a|

a|
Node management interface default gateway

The IP address for the router on the node management network.

a|
NTP server addresses

The IP addresses of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers at your site. These servers are used to synchronize the time across the cluster.
