If you are already familiar with basic networking concepts, you might be able to save time setting up your network by reviewing this "hands on" workflow for NAS path failover configuration.

A NAS LIF automatically migrates to a surviving network port after a link failure on its current port. If your network is flat, you can rely on the ONTAP defaults to manage path failover. Otherwise, you should configure path failover following the steps in this workflow.

[NOTE]
A SAN LIF does not migrate (unless you move it manually after the link failure). Instead, multipathing technology on the host diverts traffic to a different LIF. For more information, see https://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.dot-cm-sanag/home.html[SAN administration^].
