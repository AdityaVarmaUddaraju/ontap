his workflow guides you through the networking configuration steps to set up NAS path failover for ONTAP 9.0 - 9.7. This workflow assumes the following:

* You want to use NAS path failover best practices that simplify network configuration.
* You want to use the CLI, not ONTAP System Manager.
* You are configuring networking on a new system running ONTAP 9.0 to 9.7.

If you are running an ONTAP release later than 9.7, you should use the NAS path failover procedure for ONTAP 9.8 or later:

* link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/networking-auto-config/index.html[ONTAP 9.8 and later NAS Path Failover Workflow^]

If you want network management details, you should use the following ONTAP 9 Network Management Reference:

* link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/networking-reference/index.html[ONTAP 9 Network Management Reference^]

If you want to use ONTAP System Manager to configure the network for ONTAP 9.7 and later, you should choose the following documentation:

*	link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/[ONTAP System Manager docs^]

If you want to use OnCommand System Manager to configure the network for ONTAP 9.7 and earlier, you should choose the following documentation:

* https://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.onc-sm-help/GUID-DF04A607-30B0-4B98-99C8-CB065C64E670.html[Cluster management using System Manager^]

If you require additional configuration or conceptual information, you should choose among the following documentation:
