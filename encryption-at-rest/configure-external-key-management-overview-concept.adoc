You can use one or more external key management servers to secure the keys that the cluster uses to access encrypted data. An external key management server is a third-party system in your storage environment that serves keys to nodes using the Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP).

[NOTE]
====
For ONTAP 9.1 and earlier versions, node management LIFs must be assigned to ports that are configured with the node management role before you can use the external key manager.
