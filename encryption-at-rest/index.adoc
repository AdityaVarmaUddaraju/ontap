NetApp offers both software- and hardware-based encryption technologies for ensuring that data at rest cannot be read if the storage medium is repurposed, returned, misplaced, or stolen.

* Software-based encryption supports data encryption one volume at a time.
* Hardware-based encryption supports full-disk encryption (FDE) of data as it is written.

You should use this content if you want to work with encryption in the following way:

* You want to use best practices, not explore every available option.
* You do not want to read a lot of conceptual background.
* You want to use the ONTAP command-line interface (CLI), not ONTAP System Manager or an automated scripting tool.
