NetApp offers both software- and hardware-based encryption technologies for ensuring that data at rest cannot be read if the storage medium is repurposed, returned, misplaced, or stolen.

* Software-based encryption supports data encryption one volume at a time.
* Hardware-based encryption supports full-disk encryption (FDE) of data as it is written.

You should use this content if you want to work with encryption in the following way:

* You want to use best practices, not explore every available option.
* You do not want to read a lot of conceptual background.
* You want to use the ONTAP command-line interface (CLI), not ONTAP System Manager or an automated scripting tool.

As of ONTAP 9.7, System Manager supports onboard key manager encryption. For more information, see the System Manager documentation:
