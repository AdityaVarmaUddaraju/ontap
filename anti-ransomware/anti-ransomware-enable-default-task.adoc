You can configure storage VMs such that new volumes are enabled by default for anti-ransomware in learning mode.

.What youâ€™ll need

*	The Multi-tenant Encryption Key Management (MT_EK_MGMT) license installed from the security and compliance bundle.

.About this task
New volumes are created by default with anti-ransomware in disabled mode, but you can change this setting in System Manager and at the CLI. Volumes enabled by default are set to anti-ransomware in learning mode.

== System Manager procedure

.	Click *Storage > Storage VMs* and then select the storage VM for default anti-virus.
.	In the *Settings* tab, [in the *Security* section], click image:Picture1.gif["pen icon"] in the *Anti-ransomware* box, then check the box to enable anti-ransomware for NAS volumes.

== CLI procedure

.	Modify an existing SVM to enable anti-ransomware by default in new volumes:
`vserver modify -vserver svm_name -anti-ransomware-default-volume-state dry-run`
+
At the CLI, you can also create a new SVM with anti-ransomware enabled by default for new volumes.
`vserver create -vserver svm_name -anti-ransomware-default-volume-state dry-run [other parameters as needed]`
