By default, warnings are issued to the console and logs if you have fewer than one hot spare drive that matches the attributes of each drive in your storage system. You can change the threshold value for these warning messages to ensure that your system adheres to best practices.

You should set the `min_spare_count` RAID option to `2` to ensure that you always have the minimum recommended number of spare disks. You can use the `storage raid-options modify -node nodename -name option_name -value 2` to set the option.
