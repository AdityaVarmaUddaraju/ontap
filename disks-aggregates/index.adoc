This content describes how to manage ONTAP physical storage using the CLI. It shows you how to create, expand, and manage aggregates, how to work with Flash Pool aggregates, how to manage disks, and how to manage RAID policies.

*You should use this content* under the following circumstances:

* You want to use the command-line interface (CLI), not ONTAP System Manager or an automated scripting tool.
* You want to use best practices, not explore every available option.
* You have a MetroCluster configuration and you are following the procedures in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-metrocluster[MetroCluster] documentation for initial configuration and guidelines for aggregates and disk management.
