You can change the ownership of aggregates among the nodes in an HA pair without interrupting service from the aggregates.

Both nodes in an HA pair are physically connected to each other's disks or array LUNs. Each disk or array LUN is owned by one of the nodes. Although ownership of disks temporarily changes when a takeover occurs, the aggregate relocation operations either permanently (for example, if done for load balancing) or temporarily (for example, if done as part of takeover) change the ownership of all disks or array LUNs within an aggregate from one node to the other. The ownership changes without any data-copy processes or physical movement of the disks or array LUNs.
