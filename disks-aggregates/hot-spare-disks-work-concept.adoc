[.lead]
A hot spare disk is a disk that is assigned to a storage system and is ready for use, but is not in use by a RAID group and does not hold any data.

If a disk failure occurs within a RAID group, the hot spare disk is automatically assigned to the RAID group to replace the failed disks. The data of the failed disk is reconstructed on the hot spare replacement disk in the background from the RAID parity disk. The reconstruction activity is logged in the `/etc/message` file and an AutoSupport message is sent.

If the available hot spare disk is not the same size as the failed disk, a disk of the next larger size is chosen and then downsized to match the size of the disk that it is replacing.
