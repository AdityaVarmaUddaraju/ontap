If an aggregate runs out of free space, various problems can result that range from loss of data to disabling a volume's guarantee. There are multiple ways to make more space in an aggregate.

All of the methods have various consequences. Prior to taking any action, you should read the relevant section in the documentation.

The following are some common ways to make space in an aggregate, in order of least to most consequences:

* Add disks to the aggregate.
* Move some volumes to another aggregate with available space.
* Shrink the size of volume-guaranteed volumes in the aggregate.
+
You can do this manually or with the `autoshrink` option of the autosize capability.

* Change volume guarantee types to `none` on volumes that are using large amounts of space (large volume-guaranteed volumes with large reserved files) so that the volumes take up less space in the aggregate.
+
A volume with a guarantee type of `none` has a smaller footprint in the aggregate than a volume with a guarantee type of `volume`.

* Delete unneeded volume Snapshot copies if the volume's guarantee type is `none`.
* Delete unneeded volumes.
* Enable space-saving features, such as deduplication or compression.
* (Temporarily) disable features that are using a large amount of metadata .
