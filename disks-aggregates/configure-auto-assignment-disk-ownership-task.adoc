You can configure ONTAP to automatically assign disk ownership according to a disk's stack, shelf, or bay. If configured, automatic disk ownership assignments occur 10 minutes after system initialization and every five minutes during normal system operation.

.What you'll need

* Your system must adhere to the requirements for automatic disk ownership.
* If you have multiple stacks or shelves that must have different ownership, one disk must have been manually assigned on each stack or shelf so that automatic ownership assignment works on each stack or shelf.
* Use the `bay autoassign-policy` only for entry level platforms. If you try to use the `bay autoassign-policy` for a non-entry level platform, it will fail.

.About this task

The behavior of the `default` automatic assignment policy depends on the system model. For entry level models, the `default` policy is equivalent to the `bay` policy. For all other systems, it is equivalent to the `stack` policy.

.Steps

. Configure automatic disk assignment:
+
`storage disk option modify -autoassign-policy _autoassign_policy_ -node _node_name_`

 ** Use `stack` as the `_autoassign_policy_` to configure automatic ownership at the stack or loop level.
 ** Use `shelf` as the `_autoassign_policy_` to configure automatic ownership at the shelf level.
 ** Use `bay` as the `_autoassign_policy_` to configure automatic ownership at the bay level.
. Verify the automatic assignment settings for the disks:
+
`storage disk option show`
