[.lead]
You can configure a Flash Pool aggregate by adding one or more allocation units from an SSD storage pool to an existing HDD aggregate.

You manage Flash Pool aggregates differently when they use SSD storage pools to provide their cache than when they use discrete SSDs.

.Step

. Display the aggregate's drives by RAID group:
+
`storage aggregate show-status _aggr_name_`
+
If the aggregate is using one or more SSD storage pools, the value for the `Position` column for the SSD RAID groups is displayed as `Shared`, and the name of the storage pool is displayed next to the RAID group name.
