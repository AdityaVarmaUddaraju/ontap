[.lead]
You can create solid state drive (SSD) storage pools to provide SSD cache for two to four Flash Pool aggregates.

.About this task

* You must supply a disk list when creating or adding disks to a storage pool.
+
Storage pools do not support a `diskcount` parameter.

* The SSDs used in the storage pool should be the same size.

.Steps

. Determine the names of the available spare SSDs:
+
`storage aggregate show-spare-disks -disk-type SSD`
+
The SSDs used in a storage pool can be owned by either node of an HA pair.

. Create the storage pool:
+
`storage pool create -storage-pool _sp_name_ -disk-list _disk1_,_disk2_,...`
. *Optional:* Verify the newly created storage pool:
+
`storage pool show -storage-pool _sp_name_`

.Results

After the SSDs are placed into the storage pool, they no longer appear as spares on the cluster, even though the storage provided by the storage pool has not yet been allocated to any Flash Pool caches. You cannot add SSDs to a RAID group as discrete drives; their storage can be provisioned only by using the allocation units of the storage pool to which they belong.
