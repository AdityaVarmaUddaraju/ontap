You might want to pause an SVM migration before the migration cutover begins. You can pause an SVM migration using the `vserver migrate pause` command.

== Pause migration

You can pause an SVM migration before client cutover starts by using the `vserver migrate pause` command.

.Steps

. From the destination cluster, pause the migration:
+
`*dest_cluster> vserver migrate pause -vserver <vserver name>*`

== Resume migrations

When youâ€™re ready to resume a paused SVM migration or when an SVM migration fails, you can use the `vserver migrate resume` command.

.Step

. Resume SVM migration:
+
`*dest_cluster> vserver migrate resume*`
. Verify that the SVM migration has resumed, and monitor the progress:
+
`*dest_cluster> vserver migrate show*`
