Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, you can tier data to local object storage using ONTAP S3.

Tiering data to a local bucket provides a simple alternative to moving data to a different local tier. This procedure automatically creates a new storage VM and a new bucket on the local cluster.

Keep in mind that once you attach to a local tier (aggregate) the cloud tier cannot be unattached.

.Step
.	Tier data to a local bucket: click *Tiers*, select a tier, then click image:icon_kabob.gif[kabob icon].

*	You have the option to create a new tier or use an existing one.
*	You have the option to edit an existing volume tiering policy, but you need to use the CLI create a new one.
*	Be sure to save the key and certificate information for later reference.
