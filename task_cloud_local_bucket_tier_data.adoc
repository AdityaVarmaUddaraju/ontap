[.lead]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, you can tier data to local object storage using ONTAP S3.

Tiering data to a local bucket provides a simple alternative to moving data to a different local tier. This procedure uses an existing bucket on the local cluster, or you can let ONTAP automatically create a new storage VM and a new bucket.

Keep in mind that once you attach to a local tier (aggr) the cloud tier cannot be unattached.

.Step
.	Tier data to a local bucket: click *Tiers*, select a tier, then click image:icon_kabob.gif[kabob icon].

*	You have the option to create a new tier (ONTAP S3) or use an existing one.
*	You have the option to edit an existing volume tiering policy.
