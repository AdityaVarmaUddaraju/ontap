After you create your data volumes, you can create the continuously available shares that the application servers use to access Hyper-V virtual machine and configuration files and SQL Server database files. You should use the share configuration worksheet as you create the SMB shares.

.Steps

. Display information about the existing data volumes and their junction paths:
+
`*volume show -vserver _vserver_name_ -junction*`
. Create a continuously available SMB share by entering the following command:
+
`*vserver cifs share create -vserver _vserver_name_ -share-name _share_name_ -path _path_ -share-properties oplocks,continuously-available -symlink "" [-comment text]*`

** You can optionally add a comment to the share configuration.

** By default, the offline files share property is configured on the share and is set to `manual`.

** ONTAP creates the share with the Windows default share permission of `Everyone` / `Full Control`.

. Repeat the previous step for all shares in the share configuration worksheet.
. Verify that your configuration is correct by using the `vserver cifs share show` command.
. Configure NTFS file permissions on the continuously available shares by mapping a drive to each share, and configuring file permissions by using the *Windows Properties* window.

.Example

The following commands create a continuously available share named "`data2`" on storage virtual machine (SVM, formerly known as Vserver) vs1. Symlinks are disabled by setting the `-symlink` parameter to `""`:
