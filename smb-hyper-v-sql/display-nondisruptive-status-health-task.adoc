[.lead]
You can use the `system health` commands to display information about the overall system health of the cluster and the health of the CIFS-NDO subsystem, to respond to alerts, to configure future alerts, and to display information about how health monitoring is configured.

.Steps

. Monitor health status by performing the appropriate action:
+
[options="header"]
|===
| If you want to display...| Enter the command...
a|
The health status of the system, which reflects the overall status of individual health monitors
a|
`*system health status show*`
a|
Information about the health status of the CIFS-NDO subsystem
a|
`*system health subsystem show -subsystem CIFS-NDO -instance*`
|===

. Display information about how CIFS-NDO alert monitoring is configured by performing the appropriate actions:
+
[options="header"]
|===
| If you want to display information about...| Enter the command...
a|
The configuration and status of the health monitor for the CIFS-NDO subsystem, such as nodes monitored, initialization state, and status
a|
`*system health config show -subsystem CIFS-NDO*`
a|
The CIFS-NDO alerts that a health monitor can potentially generate
a|
`*system health alert definition show -subsystem CIFS-NDO*`
a|
CIFS-NDO health monitor policies, which determine when alerts are raised
a|
`*system health policy definition show -monitor node-connect*`
|===
+
[NOTE]
====
Use the `-instance` parameter to display detailed information.

.Examples

The following output shows information about the overall health status of the cluster and the CIFS-NDO subsystem:

----
cluster1::> system health status show
Status
---------------
ok

cluster1::> system health subsystem show -instance -subsystem CIFS-NDO

                   Subsystem: CIFS-NDO
                      Health: ok
        Initialization State: initialized
Number of Outstanding Alerts: 0
 Number of Suppressed Alerts: 0
                        Node: node2
