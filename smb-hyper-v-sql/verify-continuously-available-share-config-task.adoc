To support nondisruptive operations, Hyper-V and SQL Server SMB shares must be configured as continuously available shares. Additionally, there are certain other share settings that you must check. You should verify that the shares are properly configured to provide seamless nondisruptive operations for the application servers if there are planned or unplanned disruptive events.

.About this task

You must verify that the two following share parameters are set correctly:

* The `-offline-files` parameter is set to either `manual` (the default) or `none`.
* Symlinks must be disabled.

For proper nondisruptive operations, the following share properties must be set:

* `continuously-available`
* `oplocks`

The following share properties must not be set:

* `homedirectory`
* `attributecache`
* `branchcache`
* `access-based-enumeration`

.Steps

. Verify that the offline files are set to `manual` or `disabled` and that symlinks are disabled:
+
`*vserver cifs shares show -vserver _vserver_name_*`
. Verify that the SMB shares are configured for continuous availability:
+
`*vserver cifs shares properties show -vserver _vserver_name_*`

.Examples

The following example displays the share setting for a share named "`share1`" on storage virtual machine (SVM, formerly known as Vserver) vs1. Offline files are set to `manual` and symlinks are disabled (designated by a hyphen in the `Symlink Properties` field output):

----

                      Vserver: vs1
                        Share: share1
     CIFS Server NetBIOS Name: VS1
                         Path: /data/share1
             Share Properties: oplocks
