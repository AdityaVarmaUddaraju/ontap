Create volumes to provide VMware datastores using the NFS protocol.

This procedure creates new volumes dedicated to VMware datastores on an link:task_nas_enable_linux_nfs.html[existing NFS-enabled storage VM]. It assumes that the following tasks have been completed according to instructions in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.exp-nfs-vaai/home.html[NFS Configuration for ESXi using VSC Express Guide]:
* You have configured the ESXi host and switches.
* Virtual Storage Console for VMware vSphere (VSC) is installed and registered with the vCenter Server that manages the ESXi host.

*Note:* It is a best practice to provision virtual environment support according to instructions in the NFS Configuration for ESXi using VSC Express Guide. Use this procedure to provision additional volumes for VMware datastores.

_This topic needs verification with SME Steven Cortez (TME). In particular, should VMware datastores be provisioned from SM, or better to use VSC?_

.Steps

. Create a new volume: click *Storage > Volumes* and then click *Add*.

. Create or modify an export policy for the volume that allows access from the ESXi host.
.. Click *Storage > Volumes*, select the new volume, click *More*, and then click *Edit Export Policy*.
.. Click *Select an existing policy* or *Add a new policy*.

. Switch to the vSphere Web Client Home page to verify access from the ESXi host.
.. Click *Hosts and Clusters*.
.. In the navigation pane, expand the datacenter to locate the datastore you created.
.. Click *Create a new virtual machine* and provide the required information in the wizard.
Select the datacenter, ESXi host, and new datastore.
The virtual machine appears in the vSphere Web Client inventory.
..  Power on the virtual machine.
