After File System Analytics is enabled, by default you can view the root directory contents of a selected volume sorted by the spaced used in each subtree.

Clicking on any file system object allows you to browse the file system and to display detailed information about each object in a directory. Information about directories can also be displayed graphically. Over time, historical data is displayed for each subtree. Space used is not sorted if there are more than 3000 directories. Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, you can display the hot files, directories, clients, and users in a specified volume for real time performance troubleshooting with <<Activity Tracking>>.

== Explorer

The File System Analytics *Explorer* screen consists of three areas:

*	Tree view of directories and subdirectories; expandable list showing name, size, modify history, and access history.
*	Files; showing name, size, and accessed time for the object selected in the directory list.
*	Active and inactive data comparison for the object selected in the directory list.
+
Beginning with ONTAP 9.9.1, you can customize the range to be reported. The default is one year. Based on these customizations, you can take corrective actions, such as moving volumes and modifying the tiering policy.

Accessed time is shown by default. However, if the volume default has been altered from the CLI, by setting the `-atime-update` option to `false` with the `volume modify` command, only last modified time is shown. For example:

  * The tree view will not display the *access history*.
  * The files view will be altered.
  * The active/inactive data view will be based on modified time (`mtime`).

Using these displays, you can examine the following:

*	File system locations consuming the most space
*	Detailed information about a directory tree, including file and subdirectory count within directories and subdirectories
*	File system locations that contain old data (for example, scratch, temp, or log trees)

Keep the following points in mind when interpreting file system analytics output:

* File system analytics show where and when your data is in use, not how much data is being processed.  For example, large space consumption by recently accessed or modified files does not necessarily indicate high system processing loads.
* The way that the *Volume Explorer* tab calculates space consumption for file system analytics might differ from other tools.  In particular, there could be significant differences compared to the consumption reported in the *Volume Overview* if the volume has storage efficiency features enabled. This is because the *Volume Explorer* tab does not include efficiency savings.
* Due to space limitations in the directory display, it is not possible to view a directory depth greater than 8 levels in the _List View_. To view directories more than 8 levels deep, you must switch to _Graphical View_, locate the desired directory, then switch back to _List View_. This will allow additional screen space in the display.

*Procedure*
|===
|In ONTAP 9.8 and 9.9 |Beginning in ONTAP 9.10.1
| Click *Storage > Volumes*, select the desired volume, then click *Explorer*.
| Select *Storage > Volumes*, select the desired volume. From the individual volume menu, select *File System > Explorer*.

== Activity Tracking

Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, you can identify hot objects with Activity Tracking. Activity Tracking enables monitoring in four categories:

*	Directories
*	Files
*	Clients
*	Users

For each category monitored, Activity Tracking will display Read IOPs, Write IOPs, Read Throughputs, and Write Throughputs. Queries on Activity Tracking refresh every 10 to 15 seconds pertaining to hot spots seen in the system over the previous five-second interval.

[Note]
Activity tracking information is approximate, and the accuracy of the data depends on the distribution of the incoming I/O traffic. 

When viewing Activity Tracking in System Manager, only the menu of the expanded volume will actively refresh. If the view of any volumes are collapsed, they will not refresh until the volume display is expanded. You can stop the refreshes with the *Pause Refresh* button. Activity data can be downloaded in a CSV format that will display all the point in time data captured for the selected volume. 

.Steps
. Select *Storage > Volumes*. Select the desired volume. From the individual volume menu, select File System and then select the Activity tab. 
. Ensure *Activity Tracking* is on to view individual reports on top directories, files, clients, and users.
. To analyze data in greater depth without refreshes, select *Pause Refresh*. You can download the data to have a CSV record of the report as well.
