It might be helpful to understand some of the basic SM-BC failover and recovery concepts.

.Planned failover

A manual operation to change the roles of copies in a SM-BC relationship. The primary becomes the secondary and the secondary becomes the primary. ALUA reporting also changes.

.Automatic unplanned failover (AUFO)

An automatic operation to perform a failover to the mirror copy. The operation requires assistance from Mediator to detect that the primary copy is unavailable.
