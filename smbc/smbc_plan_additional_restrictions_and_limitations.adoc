There are several additional restrictions and limitations when using the SnapMirror Business Continuity solution.

=== Consistency groups

From ONTAP 9.8 to 9.9.1, the maximum number of SnapMirror Synchronous consistency group relationships in a cluster is five, a limit which is platform-independent. Beginning in ONTAP 9.10.1, the maximum number of SnapMirror Synchronous consistency group relationships in a cluster is 20. If you reach or attempt to exceed this limit, an error message will display.

=== Volumes per consistency group

From ONTAP 9.8 to 9.9.1, the maximum number of volumes supported per SnapMirror Synchronous consistency group relationship is twelve, a limit which is platform-independent. Beginning in ONTAP 9.10.1, the maximum number of volumes supported per SnapMirror Synchronous relationship is sixteen. If you reach or attempt to exceed this limit, an error message will display.

=== Volumes

[NOTE]
The limit is on the number of endpoints and not the number of relationships. A consistency group with 12 volumes contributes 12 endpoints on both the source and destination.A SnapMirror Synchronous relationship with both source and destination volumes on the same HA pair contributes 2 endpoints.

The maximum endpoints per platform are included in the following table.

=== SAN object limits

The following SAN object limits are included in the following table and apply regardless of the platform.

|LUN maps per node
|2048
|LUN maps per cluster

|LIFs per VServer (with at least one volume in an SM-BC relationship)

=== NTFS security style

NTFS security style is not supported on SM-BC volumes.
