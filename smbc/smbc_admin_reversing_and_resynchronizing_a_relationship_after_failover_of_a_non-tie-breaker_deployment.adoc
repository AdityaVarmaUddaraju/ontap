After a planned or unplanned failover in a non-tie-breaker deployment, where the secondary site is failed over and serving data, and the primary is operational, you must perform resync operation to reverse and resynchronize (flip resync) the relationship.

.About this task

In a tie-breaker deployment, the flip resync operation is performed automatically after failover.  After the reversed relationship is established, the primary and secondary site will switch roles.

.Steps

. Resynchronize the relationship from the new source:
+
`primary::>snapmirror resync -destination-path vs1_dst:/cg/cg_src`
