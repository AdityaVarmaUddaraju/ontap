An automatic unplanned failover (AUFO) operation occurs when the primary cluster is down or isolated.  When this occurs, the secondary cluster is converted to the primary and begins serving clients. This operation is performed only with assistance from the ONTAP Mediator.

[NOTE]
After the automatic unplanned failover, it is important to rescan the host LUN I/O paths so that there is no loss of I/O paths.

You can monitor the status of the automatic unplanned failover by using the `snapmirror failover show` command.
