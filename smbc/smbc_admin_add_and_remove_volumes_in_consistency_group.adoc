[.lead]
If you want to change the composition of the consistency group by adding or removing a volume, you must first delete the original relationship and then create the consistency group again with the new composition.

.About this task

* The composition change is not allowed when the consistency group is in the “InSync” state.
* The destination volume should be of type DP.

[Note]
The new volume you add to expand the consistency group must have a pair of common Snapshot copies between the source and destination volumes.

.Steps

. Delete the zero RTO consistency group relationship:
+
`destination::>snapmirror delete -destination-path vs1_dst:/cg/cg_dst`

. Release the source side SnapMirror relationship and retain common Snapshot copies:
+
`source::>snapmirror release -relationship-info-only true -destination-path vs1_dst:/cg/cg_dst`

. Create the new consistency group with the new composition:
+
`destination::> snapmirror create -source-path vs1_src:/cg/cg_src -destination-path vs1_dst:/cg/cg_dst -cg-item-mappings vol_src2:@vol_dst2`

. Resynchronize the zero RTO consistency group relationship to ensure it is in sync:
+
`destination::> snapmirror resync -destination-path vs1_dst:/cg/cg_dst`
