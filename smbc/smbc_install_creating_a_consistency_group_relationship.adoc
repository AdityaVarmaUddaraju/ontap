You must create a SnapMirror consistency group which also establishes the synchronous consistency group relationship.

.Before you begin

The following prerequisites and restrictions apply:

* You must be a cluster or storage VM administrator
* You must have a SnapMirror Synchronous license
* The destination volumes must be type DP
* The primary and the secondary storage VM must be in a peered relationship
* All constituent volumes in a consistency group must be in a single Storage VM

.About this task

You must create the consistency group relationship from the destination cluster.  You can map up to 12 constituents using the `cg-item-mappings` parameter on the `snapmirror create` command.

.Steps

. Create a consistency group and constituent relationship. This example creates two consistency groups: srccg with constituent volumes vol1 and vol2, and dstcg with constituent volumes vol1_dr and vol2_dr.
