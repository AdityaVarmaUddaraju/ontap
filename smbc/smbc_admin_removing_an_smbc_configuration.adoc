You can remove zero RTO Synchronous SnapMirror protection and delete the SM-BC relationship configuration.

.About this task

Before you delete the SM-BC relationship, all LUNs in the destination cluster must be unmapped.
After the LUNs are unmapped and the host is rescanned, the SCSI target notifies the hosts that the LUN inventory has changed. The existing LUNs on the zero RTO secondary volumes change to reflect a new identity after the zero RTO relationship is deleted. Hosts discover the secondary volume LUNs as new LUNs that have no relationship to the source volume LUNs.
The secondary volumes remain DP volumes after the relationship is deleted. You can issue the snapmirror break  command to convert them to read/write.
Deleting the relationship is not allowed in the failed-over state when the relationship is not reversed.

.Steps

. Delete the SM-BC consistency group relationship:
+
`Destination::>snapmirror delete -destination-path vs1_dst:/cg/cg_dst`

. From the source cluster, release the consistency group relationship and the Snapshot copies created for the relationship:
+
`Source::>snapmirror release -destination-path vs1_dst:/cg/cg_dst`

. Perform a host rescan to update the LUN inventory.
