There are several prerequisites that you should consider as part of planning a SnapMirror Business Continuity solution deployment.

=== Hardware

* Only two-node HA clusters are supported
* Both clusters must be either AFF or ASA (no mixing)

=== Software

* ONTAP 9.8 or later
* ONTAP Mediator 1.2 or later
* A Linux server or virtual machine for the ONTAP Mediator running one of the following:
** RedHat Enterprise Linux 7.6 or 7. 7
** CentOS 8.0 or 8.1

=== Licensing

* SnapMirror synchronous (SM-S) license must be applied on both clusters
+
[NOTE]
If your ONTAP storage systems were purchased before June 2019, click https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/knowledge/docs/olio/guides/master_lickey/[NetApp ONTAP Master License Keys^] to get the required SM-S license.

=== Networking environment

* Inter-cluster latency must be less than 10 milliseconds

=== Supported protocols

* Only SAN protocols are supported (not NFS/CIFS)
* Only Fibre Channel and iSCSI protocols are supported

=== ONTAP Mediator

* Must be provisioned externally and attached to ONTAP for transparent application failover

=== AppDM Application volumes

Volumes associated with an AppDM Application are not supported with SM-BC. Before creating an SM- BC relationship for a set of volumes, make sure that none of theÂ volumes are associated with an AppDM Application.

[NOTE]
In ONTAP 9.8 RC releases, SM-BC does not automatically check before creating a relationship with a set of AppDM Application volumes.
