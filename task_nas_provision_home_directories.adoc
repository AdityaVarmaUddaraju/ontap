.Steps

. Create a new volume: click *Storage > Volumes* and then click *Add*.

. Create a home directory share: click *Storage > Shares*, click *Add*, and select *Home Directory*.

. Switch to a Windows client to verify that the share is accessible.

.. In Windows Explorer, map a drive to the share in the following format: `+\\_SMB_Server_Name__Share_Name_+`
If the share name was created with variables (%w, %d, or %u), be sure to test access with a resolved name.

.. On the newly created drive, create a test file, and then delete the file.
