[.lead]
For each dump and restore event, a message is written to the backup log file.

The format of the dump and restore event log message is as follows:

`_type timestamp identifier event (event_info)_`

The following list describes the fields in the event log message format:

* Each log message begins with one of the type indicators described in the following table:
+
[options="header"]
|===
| Type| Description
a|
log
a|
Logging event
a|
dmp
a|
Dump event
a|
rst
a|
Restore event
|===

* `timestamp` shows the date and time of the event.
* The `identifier` field for a dump event includes the dump path and the unique ID for the dump. The `identifier` field for a restore event uses only the restore destination path name as a unique identifier. Logging-related event messages do not include an `identifier` field.
