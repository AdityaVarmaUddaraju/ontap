NetApp ONTAP 9.7 is the latest version of NetApp’s proven data management software. You can run ONTAP in your own data center on NetApp-engineered hardware, on your own commodity hardware, or in any of the major public clouds.

The most noticeable feature of ONTAP 9.7 is the all-new ONTAP System Manager interface. This web-based interface gets you up and running with just a few clicks.
It shows you the status of your cluster and guides you to the best way to achieve your storage goals.

If you are familiar with a previous version of ONTAP, you will feel right at home.
But we did change a few terms in ONTAP System Manager that might confuse you. Watch out for these new terms.
* Local tier – a set of physical solid-state drives or hard-disk drives you store your data on. You might know these as aggregates. In fact, if you use the ONTAP CLI, you will still see the term aggregate.
*	Cloud tier – storage in the cloud used by ONTAP when you want to have some of your data off premises for one of several reasons. If you are thinking of the cloud or StorageGRID part of a FabricPool, you’ve already figured it out. And if you are using a StorageGRID system, your cloud might not be off premises at all. (A cloud like experience on premises is called a _private cloud_.)
*	Storage VM – a virtual machine running within ONTAP that provides storage and data services to your clients. You might know these as SVMs or vservers. Same great feature, new name.

If you are new to ONTAP, here are a few other concepts that will get you up to speed.
*	Cluster – that’s the big picture. A cluster is made up of one or more nodes. Think of nodes as computers that specialize in data management and storage. You can add nodes to your cluster as your needs grow, or you can replace smaller nodes with bigger nodes. All without interrupting access to your data, of course.
*	Snapshot copies – an instant copy of your data that you can use to undo a mistake, mirror to another cluster, even copy to tape. Without interruption to your clients. And who can afford downtime?
*	Data protection - what you use depends on what you need to protect against and how long you can wait to recover if something goes wrong. ONTAP offers synchronous and asynchronous mirroring and more.
* HA pair – speaking of avoiding downtime, the high-availability pair is the basic unit of an ONTAP cluster. It’s made up of two partner nodes that can take over for each other. Say you want to upgrade to the latest version of ONTAP to get a great new data management feature. Just have the partner take over a node’s client load, upgrade that client, and then give the load back. Repeat for the partner node and you have just upgraded without any disruption.
* Storage efficiency – disks cost money, real money, but storage efficiency lets you save more data in less space. And that saves real money and makes you a data hero. You can use any or all of compression, deduplication, and compaction. I’m sure you already know what compression is. Deduplication identifies multiple copies of the same data and replaces the duplicates with pointers to a single copy. Compaction puts multiple small files into a single block of storage, filling in what would otherwise be wasted space.
*	Security – you read about security breaches in the news every day. And you do not want to be seeing your company’s name in one of those stories! ONTAP helps you out in many ways, such as using multifactor authentication for administrators, encrypting data on disk and in flight, and using antivirus tools to protect Windows files.
* Volumes – are exactly what you think volumes are. Containers to store files. You can export volumes to Linux clients, share volumes with Windows clients, or even do both at the same time with the same files.
*	LUNs – the basic unit of SAN. That’s Fibre Channel and iSCSI. In a SAN environment, ONTAP provides virtual disks to clients instead of files. Database applications often want virtual disks that they can manage at a low level or apply a specialized file system to. Many, but not all ONTAP systems can serve data to SAN clients.
* NVMe namespaces – the new kid on the block. The NVMe protocol is optimized for SSD-based storage, and it is really fast. NVMe is a flavor of SAN, but the basic unit of storage is called a namespace instead of a LUN.

So now you know the basics of ONTAP and you’re ready to get to work. Watch the videos and read the sections that follow to learn how to set up and manage your cluster with System Manager.
