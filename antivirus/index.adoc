This content describes how to use NetApp virus scanning, called _Vscan_, to protect data from being compromised by viruses or other malicious code. It shows you how to use on-access scanning to check for viruses when clients access files over CIFS, and how to use on-demand scanning to check for viruses immediately or on a schedule.

You should use this content if you want to work with Vscan in the following ways:

* You want to use the ONTAP command-line interface (CLI), not ONTAP System Manager or an automated scripting tool.
+
Vscan is not supported by System Manager.
