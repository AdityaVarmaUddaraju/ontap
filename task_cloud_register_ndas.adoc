If you are using NetApp Data Availability Services (NDAS) to back up your data to the cloud or StorageGRID, you must first register the ONTAP cluster that contains the volumes to be protected. A registration key is generated automatically within the NDAS app and the key must be entered on the ONTAP cluster using System Manager.

Before registering the ONTAP cluster with NDAS, link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/netapp-data-availability-services/concept_cluster_and_snapmirror_requirements.html[ONTAP cluster and SnapMirror requirements] must be satisfied.

For more information, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/netapp-data-availability-services/task_registering_ontap_target_storage.html[Registering ONTAP target storage with NetApp Data Availability Services].
