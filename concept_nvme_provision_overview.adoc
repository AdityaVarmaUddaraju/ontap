The topics in this section show you how to configure and manage NVMe with ONTAP System Manager in ONTAP 9.7 and later releases.

If you are using the ONTAP CLI to configure and manage NVMe, see this content:

*	link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/san-config/index.html[SAN Configuration Guide]

If you are using legacy OnCommand System Manager for ONTAP 9.7 and earlier releases to configure and manage NVMe, see the content for your ONTAP release:

== NVMe overview

You can use the non-volatile memory express (NVMe) protocol to provide storage in a SAN environment.  The NVMe protocol is optimized for performance with solid state storage.

For NVMe, storage targets are called namespaces.  An NVMe namespace is a quantity of non-volatile storage that can be formatted into logical blocks and presented to a host as a standard block device.  You create namespaces and subsystems, and then map the namespaces to the subsystems, similar to the way LUNs are provisioned and mapped to igroups for FC and iSCSI.

NVMe targets are connected to the network through a standard FC infrastructure using FC switches and host-side adapters.
