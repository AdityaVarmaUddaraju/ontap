If you no longer need an IPspace, you can delete it.

.Before you begin

There must be no broadcast domains, network interfaces, or SVMs associated with the IPspace you want to delete.

The system-defined "Default" and "Cluster" IPspaces cannot be deleted.

.Step

Delete an IPspace:

....
network ipspace delete -ipspace ipspace_name
....

The following command deletes IPspace ipspace1 from the cluster:

....
network ipspace delete -ipspace ipspace1
....
