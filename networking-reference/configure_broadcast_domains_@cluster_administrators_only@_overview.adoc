Broadcast domains are intended to group network ports that belong to the same layer 2 network. The ports in the group can then be used by a storage virtual machine (SVM) for data or management traffic.

A broadcast domain resides in an IPspace. During cluster initialization, the system creates two default broadcast domains:

* The "Default" broadcast domain contains ports that are in the "Default" IPspace.
+
These ports are used primarily to serve data. Cluster management and node management ports are also in this broadcast domain.
* The "Cluster" broadcast domain contains ports that are in the "Cluster" IPspace.
+
These ports are used for cluster communication and include all cluster ports from all nodes in the cluster.
+
The system creates additional broadcast domains in the Default IPspace when necessary. The "Default" broadcast domain contains the home-port of the management LIF, plus any other ports that have layer 2 reachability to that port. Additional broadcast domains are named "Default-1", "Default-2", and so forth.
