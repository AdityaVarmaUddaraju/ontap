Broadcast domains are intended to group network ports that belong to the same layer 2 network. The ports in the group can then be used by a storage virtual machine (SVM) for data or management traffic.

A broadcast domain resides in an IPspace. During cluster initialization, the system creates two default broadcast domains:

* The Default broadcast domain contains ports that are in the Default IPspace.
These ports are used primarily to serve data. Cluster management and node management ports are also in this broadcast domain.

* The Cluster broadcast domain contains ports that are in the Cluster IPspace.
These ports are used for cluster communication and include all cluster ports from all nodes in the cluster.

If you have created unique IPspaces to separate client traffic, then you need to create a broadcast domain in each of those IPspaces.

[NOTE]
Create a broadcast domain to group network ports in the cluster that belong to the same layer 2 network. The ports can then be used by SVMs.
