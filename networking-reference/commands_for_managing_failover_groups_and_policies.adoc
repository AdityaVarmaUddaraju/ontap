You can use the `network interface failover-groups` commands to manage failover groups. You use the `network interface modify` command to manage the failover groups and failover policies that are applied to a LIF.

|===
|If you want to... |Use this command...

|Add network ports to a failover group
|network interface failover-groups add- targets
|Remove network ports from a failover group
|network interface failover-groups remove- targets
|Modify network ports in a failover group
|network interface failover-groups modify
|Display the current failover groups
|network interface failover-groups show
|Configure failover on a LIF
|network interface modify -failover-group - failover-policy
|Display the failover group and failover policy that is being used by each LIF
|network interface show -fields failover- group, failover-policy
|Rename a failover group
|network interface failover-groups rename
|Delete a failover group
|network interface failover-groups delete
|===

[NOTE]
Modifying a failover group such that it does not provide a valid failover target for any LIF in the cluster can result in an outage when a LIF attempts to fail over.

For more information, see the man pages for the `network interface failover-groups` and `network interface modify` commands.
