A LIF (logical interface) is an IP address or WWPN with associated characteristics, such as a service policy, a home port, a home node, a list of ports to fail over to, and a firewall policy. You can configure LIFs on ports over which the cluster sends and receives communications over the network.

LIFs can be hosted on the following ports:

* Physical ports that are not part of interface groups
* Interface groups
* VLANs
* Physical ports or interface groups that host VLANs
* Virtual IP (VIP) ports
+
Starting with ONTAP 9.5, VIP LIFs are supported and are hosted on VIP ports.

While configuring SAN protocols such as FC on a LIF, it will be associated with a WWPN.
