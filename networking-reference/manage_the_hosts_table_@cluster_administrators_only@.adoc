A cluster administrator can add, modify, delete, and view the host name entries in the hosts table of the admin storage virtual machine (SVM). An SVM administrator can configure the host name entries only for the assigned SVM.

== Commands for managing local host-name entries

You can use the `vserver services name-service dns hosts` command to create, modify, or delete DNS host table entries.

When you are creating or modifying the DNS host-name entries, you can specify multiple alias addresses separated by commas.
