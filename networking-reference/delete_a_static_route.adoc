You can delete an unneeded static route from a storage virtual machine (SVM).

.Step

Use the `network route delete` command to delete a static route.

For more information about this command, see the `network route` man page: http://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.dot-cm-cmpr/GUID-5CB10C70-AC11-41C0-8C16-B4D0DF916E9B.html[ONTAP 9 commands^].

The following example deletes a static route associated with SVM vs0 with a gateway of 10.63.0.1 and a destination IP address of 0.0.0.0/0:

....
network route delete -vserver vs0 -gateway 10.63.0.1 -destination 0.0.0.0/0
....
