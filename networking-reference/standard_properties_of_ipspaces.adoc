Special IPspaces are created by default when the cluster is first created. Additionally, special storage virtual machines (SVMs) are created for each IPspace.

Two IPspaces are created automatically when the cluster is initialized:

* "Default" IPspace
+
This IPspace is a container for ports, subnets, and SVMs that serve data. If your configuration does not need separate IPspaces for clients, all SVMs can be created in this IPspace. This IPspace also contains the cluster management and node management ports.
* "Cluster" IPspace
+
This IPspace contains all cluster ports from all nodes in the cluster. It is created automatically when the cluster is created. It provides connectivity to the internal private cluster network. As additional nodes join the cluster, cluster ports from those nodes are added to the "Cluster" IPspace.

A "system" SVM exists for each IPspace. When you create an IPspace, a default system SVM of the same name is created:

* The system SVM for the "Cluster" IPspace carries cluster traffic between nodes of a cluster on the internal private cluster network.
+
It is managed by the cluster administrator, and it has the name "Cluster".
* The system SVM for the "Default" IPspace carries management traffic for the cluster and nodes, including the intercluster traffic between clusters.
+
It is managed by the cluster administrator, and it uses the same name as the cluster.
* The system SVM for a custom IPspace that you create carries management traffic for that SVM.
+
It is managed by the cluster administrator, and it uses the same name as the IPspace.

One or more SVMs for clients can exist in an IPspace. Each client SVM has its own data volumes and configurations, and it is administered independently of other SVMs.
