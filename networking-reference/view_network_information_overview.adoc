You can view information related to ports, LIFs, routes, failover rules, failover groups, firewall rules, DNS, NIS, and connections.

This information can be useful in situations such as reconfiguring networking settings, or when troubleshooting the cluster.

If you are a cluster administrator, you can view all the available networking information. If you are an SVM administrator, you can view only the information related to your assigned SVMs.
