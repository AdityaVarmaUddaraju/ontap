You can use FlexCache volumes to speed up access to data or to offload traffic from heavily accessed volumes. FlexCache volumes are ideal for read-intensive workloads, especially where clients need to access the same data repeatedly.

The FlexCache volume can be on the same cluster as or on a different cluster than that of the remote volume. If the remote volume is on a different cluster, you need to have already peered the clusters and storage VMs.

.Steps

. Click *Storage > Volumes*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *More Options* and then select *Add as cache for a remote volume*.

For any new data requests, the FlexCache volume requests the data from the remote volume and stores it. All the subsequent read requests for the data are then served directly from the FlexCache volume.
