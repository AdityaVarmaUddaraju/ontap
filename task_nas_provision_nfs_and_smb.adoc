Create volumes to provide storage for clients using either the NFS or SMB/CIFS protocol.

This procedure creates new volumes on an link:task_nas_enable_nfs_and_smb.html[existing storage VM enabled for both NFS and SMB protocols].

.Steps

. Create a new volume: click *Storage > Volumes* and then click *Add*.

.. Create an export policy: click *More Options* and check *Share via NFS*.
The default setting grants full access to all users. You can add more restrictive rules to the export policy later.

.. Create a share: check *Share via SMB/CIFS*.
The share is created with a default Access Control List (ACL) set to Full Control for the Everyone group. You can add restrictions to the ACL later.

. Switch to a Linux client to verify that the export is accessible.

.. Create and mount the volume using the LIF of the storage VM.

.. On the newly mounted volume, create a test file, write text to it, and then delete the file.

. Switch to a Windows client to verify that the share is accessible.

.. In Windows Explorer, map a drive to the share in the following format: `+\\_SMB_Server_Name__Share_Name_+`

.. On the newly created drive, create a test file, write text to it, and then delete the file.

After verifying access, you might want to link:task_nas_provision_export_policies.html[restrict client access with the volumeâ€™s export policy, restrict client access with the share ACL], and set any desired ownership and permissions on the exported and shared volume.
