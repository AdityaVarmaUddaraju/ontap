You can change the queue depth on AIX hosts using the `chdev` command. Changes made using the `chdev` command persist across reboots.

Examples:

* To change the queue depth for the hdisk7 device, use the following command:
+
`chdev -l hdisk7 -a queue_depth=32`

* To change the queue depth for the fcs0 HBA, use the following command:
+
`chdev -l fcs0 -a num_cmd_elems=128`
+
The default value for `num_cmd_elems` is 200. The maximum value is 2,048.
+
[NOTE]
====
It might be necessary to take the HBA offline to change `num_cmd_elems` and then bring it back online using the `rmdev -l fcs0 -R` and `makdev -l fcs0 -P` commands.
