Static VLANs are port-based. The switch and switch port are used to define the VLAN and its members.

Static VLANs offer improved security because it is not possible to breach VLANs using media access control (MAC) spoofing. However, if someone has physical access to the switch, replacing a cable and reconfiguring the network address can allow access.

In some environments, it is easier to create and manage static VLANs than dynamic VLANs. This is because static VLANs require only the switch and port identifier to be specified, instead of the 48-bit MAC address. In addition, you can label switch port ranges with the VLAN identifier.
