By default the X1143A-R6 adapter is configured in FC target mode, but you can configure its ports as either 10 Gb Ethernet and FCoE (CNA) ports or as 16 Gb FC initiator or target ports, this will require different SFP+ adapters.

Port pairs connected to the same ASIC must be configured in the same mode.

In FC mode, the X1143A-R6 adapter behaves just like any existing FC device with speeds up to 16 Gbps. In CNA mode, you can use the X1143A-R6 adapter for concurrent NIC and FCoE traffic sharing the same 10 GbE port. CNA mode only supports FC target mode for the FCoE function.
