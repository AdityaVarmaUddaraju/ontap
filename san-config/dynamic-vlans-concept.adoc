Dynamic VLANs are MAC address-based. You can define a VLAN by specifying the MAC address of the members you want to include.

Dynamic VLANs provide flexibility and do not require mapping to the physical ports where the device is physically connected to the switch. You can move a cable from one port to another without reconfiguring the VLAN.
