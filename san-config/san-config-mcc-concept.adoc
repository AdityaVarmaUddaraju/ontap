You must be aware of certain considerations when using SAN configurations in a MetroCluster environment.

* Two-node, four-node, and eight-node MetroCluster configurations do not support front-end FC fabric "`routed`" vSAN configurations.
* Two-node, four-node, and eight-node MetroCluster configurations support SAN protocols.
* When using SAN client configurations, you must check whether any special considerations for MetroCluster configurations are included in the notes that are provided in the Interoperability Matrix Tool (IMT).
* The NVMe protocol is not supported on MetroCluster configurations.
* The MetroCluster is using the same WWPNs on both sides of the front-end SAN.

To avoid overlap when the old port goes offline and the new port comes online, use the following steps to configure the front-end switches:
+
[cols="2*",options="header"]
|===
| For a..| Use these steps:
a|
Cisco switch
a|
Step 1. Connect to the switch and log in.

Step 2. Enter configuration mode:

----
switch# config t
switch(config)#
----

Step 3. Overwrite the first device entry in the name server database with the new device:

----
switch(config)# no fcns reject-duplicate-pwwn vsan 1
----
a|
Brocade switch
a|
Step 1. Connect to the switch and log in.

Step 2. Enter the `switchDisable` command.

Step 3. Enter the `configure` command, and press `y` at the prompt.

----
F-Port login parameters (yes, y, no, n): [no] y
----

Step 4. Choose setting 1:

----
- 0: First login take precedence over the second login (default)
- 1: Second login overrides first login.
- 2: the port type determines the behavior

Enforce FLOGI/FDISC login: (0..2) [0] 1
----

Step 5. Respond to the remaining prompts, or press *Ctrl + D*.

Step 6. Enter the `switchEnable` command.
