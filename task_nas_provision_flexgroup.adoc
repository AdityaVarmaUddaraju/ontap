A FlexGroup volume is a scalable NAS container that provides high performance along with automatic load distribution. FlexGroup volumes provide massive capacity (in petabytes), which considerably exceeds the FlexVol volume limits, without adding  any management overhead.

The topics in this section show you how to manage FlexGroup volumes with ONTAP System Manager in ONTAP 9.7 and later releases. If you are using the classic System Manager (available only in ONTAP 9.7 and earlier), see this content:
+
https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-sm-classic/online-help-96-97/task_creating_flexgroup_volumes.html[Create FlexGroup volumes^]

Beginning with ONTAP 9.9.1, SnapMirror fanout relationships of 2 or more FlexGroup volumes are supported, with a maximum of 8 fanout legs. System Manager does not support SnapMirror cascading FlexGroup volume relationships.

ONTAP automatically selects the local tiers required for creating the FlexGroup volume.
