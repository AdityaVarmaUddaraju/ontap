summary: A FlexGroup volume is a scalable NAS container that provides high performance along with automatic load distribution. FlexGroup volumes provide massive capacity (in petabytes), which considerably exceeds the FlexVol volume limits, without adding  any management overhead.

A FlexGroup volume is a scalable NAS container that provides high performance along with automatic load distribution. FlexGroup volumes provide massive capacity (in petabytes), which considerably exceeds the FlexVol volume limits, without adding  any management overhead.

ONTAP automatically selects the local tiers required for creating the FlexGroup volume.

NOTE: Beginning in ONTAP 9.8, when you provision storage, QoS is enabled by default. You can disable QoS or choose a custom QoS policy during the provisioning process or at a later time.
