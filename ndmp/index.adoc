This content describes how to quickly configure an ONTAP 9 cluster to use the Network Data Management Protocol (NDMP) to back up data directly to tape using a third-party backup application.

You should use this content if you want to configure NDMP in the following context:

* The cluster is running ONTAP 9.
* You have a third-party backup application (also called a Data Management Application or DMA).
* You are a cluster administrator.
* You want to perform backup operations either at the cluster level (using the admin storage virtual machine (SVM)) or node level.
* Tape devices and an optional media server are installed. 
* Tape devices are connected to the cluster through a Fibre Channel (FC) switch and not directly attached. 
* At least one tape device has a logical unit number (LUN) of 0.
* You want to use best practices, not explore every available option.
* You do not want to read a lot of conceptual background.

If these assumptions are not correct for your situation, you should see link:../tape-backup/index.html[Data protection using tape backup]
