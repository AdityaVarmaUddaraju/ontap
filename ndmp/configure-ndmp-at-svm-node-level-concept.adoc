summary: "If the backup application supports Cluster Aware Backup (CAB), you can configure NDMP as SVM-scoped at the cluster (admin SVM) level, which enables you to back up all volumes hosted across different nodes of the cluster. Otherwise, you can configure node-scoped NDMP, which enables you to back up all the volumes hosted on that node."

If the backup application supports Cluster Aware Backup (CAB), you can configure NDMP as SVM-scoped at the cluster (admin SVM) level, which enables you to back up all volumes hosted across different nodes of the cluster. Otherwise, you can configure node-scoped NDMP, which enables you to back up all the volumes hosted on that node.
