[.lead]
To authenticate NDMP from the backup application, you must create a local backup user, or an NIS or LDAP user for the cluster with the admin or backup role, and generate an NDMP password for the backup user.

.What you'll need

If you are using an NIS or LDAP user, the user must be created on the respective server. You cannot use an Active Directory user.

.Steps

. Create a backup user with the `admin` or `backup` role by using the `security login create` command.
+
You can specify a local backup user name or an NIS or LDAP user name for the `-user-or-group-name` parameter.
+
The following command creates the backup user backup_admin1 with the `backup` role:
+
----
cluster1::> security login create -user-or-group-name backup_admin1 -application ssh
-authmethod password -role backup

Please enter a password for user 'backup_admin1':
Please enter it again:
----

. Generate a password for the admin SVM by using the `vserver services ndmp generate password` command.
+
The generated password must be used to authenticate the NDMP connection by the backup application.
+
----
cluster1::> vserver services ndmp generate-password -vserver cluster1 -user backup_admin1

 Vserver: cluster1
    User: backup_admin1
