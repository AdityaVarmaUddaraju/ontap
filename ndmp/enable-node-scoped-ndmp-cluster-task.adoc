You can back up volumes hosted on a node by enabling node-scoped NDMP, setting up the password for the root user, and configuring a LIF for data and control connection.

You can configure node-scoped NDMP by enabling node-scoped NDMP on the cluster and NDMP service on all nodes of the cluster. You must also configure the `root` user for NDMP when enabling the NDMP service.

.Steps

. Enable node-scoped NDMP mode by using the `system services ndmp` command with the `node-scope-mode` parameter.
+
----
cluster1::> system services ndmp node-scope-mode on
NDMP node-scope-mode is enabled.
----

. Enable NDMP service on all nodes in the cluster by using the `system services ndmp on` command.
+
Using the wildcard "`*`" enables NDMP service on all nodes at the same time.
+
You must specify a password for authentication of the NDMP connection by the backup application.
+
----
cluster1::> system services ndmp on -node *

Please enter password:
Confirm password:

----

. Disable the `-clear-text` option for secure communication of the NDMP password by using the `system services ndmp modify` command.
+
Using the wildcard "`*`" disables the `-clear-text` option on all nodes at the same time.
+
----
cluster1::> system services ndmp modify -node * -clear-text false
2 entries were modified.
----

. Verify that NDMP service is enabled and the `-clear-text` option is disabled by using the `system services ndmp show` command.
