This content is for administrators of on-premises ONTAP systems who want to start using "`the cloud.`" It maps what you already know about ONTAP features to the equivalent products and features in the cloud.

You should use this content if you are already familiar with ONTAP but are not as familiar with cloud-based products. This content helps you understand what you *can do* in the cloud and points you to other resources to learn *how*.

The following cloud-based NetApp products are discussed in this content:

* Cloud Volumes ONTAP
+
A software-only storage appliance that runs ONTAP data management software in the cloud.

* Cloud Volume Services
+
Cloud native file services that provide metered file storage for NAS volumes. Three options are offered:

 ** Azure NetApp Files
 ** Cloud Volumes Service for AWS
 ** Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud

Whether you are new to these cloud products or already familiar with them, you can find more information at https://www.netapp.com/support-and-training/documentation/[NetApp Product Documentation^].
