You must have SnapLock administrator privileges to perform a privileged delete. These privileges are defined in the vsadmin-snaplock role. If you have not already been assigned that role, you can ask your cluster administrator to create an SVM administrator account with the SnapLock administrator role.

.What you'll need

* You must be a cluster administrator to perform this task.
* You must have logged in on a secure connection (SSH, console, or ZAPI).

.Steps

. Create an SVM administrator account with the SnapLock administrator role:
+
`*security login create -vserver _SVM_name_ -user-or-group-name _user_or_group_name_ -application _application_ -authmethod _authentication_method_ -role _role_ -comment _comment_*`
+
The following command enables the SVM administrator account `SnapLockAdmin` with the predefined `vsadmin-snaplock` role to access `SVM1` using a password:
