summary: "You can use any suitable command or program over NFS or CIFS to create a WORM appendable file. A WORM appendable file retains data written incrementally, like log entries. Data is appended to the file in 256 KB chunks. As each chunk is written, the previous chunk becomes WORM-protected. You cannot delete the file until the retention period has elapsed."

You can use any suitable command or program over NFS or CIFS to create a WORM appendable file. A WORM appendable file retains data written incrementally, like log entries. Data is appended to the file in 256 KB chunks. As each chunk is written, the previous chunk becomes WORM-protected. You cannot delete the file until the retention period has elapsed.

.What you'll need

The WORM appendable file must reside on a SnapLock volume.

.About this task

Data does not have to be written sequentially to the active 256 KB chunk. When data is written to byte nÃ—256KB+1 of the file, the previous 256 KB segment becomes WORM-protected.

.Steps

. Use a suitable command or program to create a zero-length file with the desired retention time.
+
In a UNIX shell, use the following command to set a retention time of 21 November 2020 6:00 a.m. on a zero-length file named `document.txt`:
+
----
touch -a -t 202011210600 document.txt
----

. Use a suitable command or program to change the read-write attribute of the file to read-only.
+
In a UNIX shell, use the following command to make a file named `document.txt` read-only:
+
----
chmod 444 document.txt
----

. Use a suitable command or program to change the read-write attribute of the file back to writable.
+
[NOTE]
====
This step is not deemed a compliance risk because there is no data in the file.
====
+
In a UNIX shell, use the following command to make a file named `document.txt` writable:
+
----
chmod 777 document.txt
----

. Use a suitable command or program to start writing data to the file.
+
In a UNIX shell, use the following command to write data to `document.txt`:
+
----
echo test data >> document.txt
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Change the file permissions back to read-only when you no longer need to append data to the file.
