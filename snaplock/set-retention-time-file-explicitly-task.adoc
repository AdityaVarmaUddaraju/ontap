[.lead]
You can set the retention time for a file explicitly by modifying its last access time. You can use any suitable command or program over NFS or CIFS to modify the last access time.

.About this task

After a file has been committed to WORM, you can extend but not shorten the retention time. The retention time is stored in the `atime` field for the file.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot explicitly set the retention time of a file to `infinite`. That value is only available when you use the default retention period to calculate the retention time.
====

.Steps

. Use a suitable command or program to modify the last access time for the file whose retention time you want to set.
+
In a UNIX shell, use the following command to set a retention time of 21 November 2020 6:00 a.m. on a file named `document.txt`:

You can use any suitable command or program to modify the last access time in Windows.
