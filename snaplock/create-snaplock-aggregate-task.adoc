[.lead]
You must create a SnapLock aggregate before creating a SnapLock volume. The Compliance or Enterprise SnapLock mode for the aggregate is inherited by the volumes in the aggregate.

.What you'll need

* You must be a cluster administrator to perform this task.
* The SnapLock license must be installed on the node.
* The ComplianceClock on the node must be initialized.
* If you have partitioned the disks as "`root`", "`data1`", and "`data2`", you must ensure that spare disks are available.

.About this task

* You cannot create Compliance aggregates for array LUNs.
* You cannot create Compliance aggregates with the SyncMirror option.
* You can create Compliance or Enterprise aggregates in a MetroCluster configuration only if the aggregate is used to host SnapLock audit log volumes.
+
[NOTE]
====
In a MetroCluster configuration, SnapLock Enterprise is supported on mirrored and unmirrored aggregates. SnapLock Compliance is supported only on unmirrored aggregates.
====

You can destroy or rename an Enterprise aggregate at any time. You cannot destroy a Compliance aggregate until the retention period has elapsed. Starting in ONTAP 9.8, you can rename a Compliance aggregate.

.Steps

. Create a SnapLock aggregate:
+
`*storage aggregate create -aggregate _aggregate_name_ -node _node_name_ -diskcount _number_of_disks_ -snaplock-type compliance|enterprise*`
+
The man page for the command contains a complete list of options.
+
The following command creates a SnapLock `Compliance` aggregate named `aggr1` with three disks on `node1`:

cluster1::> storage aggregate create -aggregate aggr1 -node node1 -diskcount 3 -snaplock-type compliance
