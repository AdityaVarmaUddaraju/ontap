summary: "You must create a SnapLock volume for the files or Snapshot copies that you want to commit to the WORM state. Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, any volume you create, regardless of the aggregate type, is created by default as a non-SnapLock volume.

You must create a SnapLock volume for the files or Snapshot copies that you want to commit to the WORM state. Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, any volume you create, regardless of the aggregate type, is created by default as a non-SnapLock volume. You must use the `-snaplock-type` option to explicitly create a SnapLock volume by specifying either Compliance or Enterprise as the SnapLock type. By default, the SnapLock type is set to `non-snaplock`.

.What you'll need

* The SnapLock aggregate must be online.
* The SnapLock license must be installed on the node.
* The ComplianceClock on the node must be initialized.

.About this task

With the proper SnapLock permissions, you can destroy or rename an Enterprise volume at any time. You cannot destroy a Compliance volume until the retention period has elapsed. You can never rename a Compliance volume.

You can clone SnapLock volumes, but you cannot clone files on a SnapLock volume. The clone volume will be of the same SnapLock type as the parent volume.

[NOTE]
====
LUNs are not supported on SnapLock volumes. Although it is possible to move LUNs onto a SnapLock volume using legacy technology, this is not a supported operation, nor is any other operation involving LUNs on a SnapLock volume.

.Steps

. Create a SnapLock volume:
+
`*volume create -vserver _SVM_name_ -volume _volume_name_ -aggregate _aggregate_name_* -snaplock-type compliance|enterprise`
+
For a complete list of options, see the man page for the command. The following options are not available for SnapLock volumes: `-nvfail`, `-atime-update`, `-is-autobalance-eligible`, `-space-mgmt-try-first`, and `vmalign`.
+
The following command creates a SnapLock `Compliance` volume named `vol1` on `aggr1` on `vs1`:
+
----
cluster1::> volume create -vserver vs1 -volume vol1 -aggregate aggr1 -snaplock-type compliance
