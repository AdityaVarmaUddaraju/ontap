[.lead]
The SnapLock autocommit feature enables you to commit files to WORM automatically.

.What you'll need

* The files you want to autocommit must reside on a SnapLock volume.
* The SnapLock volume must be online.
* The SnapLock volume must be a read-write volume.

[NOTE]
====
The SnapLock autocommit feature scans through all of the files in the volume and commits a file if it meets the autocommit requirement. There might be a time interval between when the file is ready for autocommit and when it is actually committed by the SnapLock autocommit scanner. However, the file is still protected from modifications and deletion by the file system as soon as it is eligible for autocommit.
====

.About this task

The _autocommit period_ specifies the amount of time that files must remain unchanged before they are autocommitted. Changing a file before the autocommit period has elapsed restarts the autocommit period for the file.

The following table shows the possible values for the autocommit period:

.Steps

. Autocommit files on a SnapLock volume to WORM:
+
`*volume snaplock modify -vserver _SVM_name_ -volume _volume_name_ -autocommit-period _autocommit_period_*`
+
For a complete list of options, see the man page for the command.
+
The following command autocommits the files on volume `vol1` of SVM vs1, as long as the files remain unchanged for 5 hours:
