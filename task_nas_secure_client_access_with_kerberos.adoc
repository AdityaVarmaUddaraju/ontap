Enable Kerberos to secure storage access for NAS clients.

This procedure configures Kerberos on an an existing storage VM enabled for link:task_nas_enable_linux_nfs.html[NFS] or link:task_nas_enable_windows_smb.html[SMB]. It assumes that you have already configured DNS, NTP, and link:task_nas_provide_client_access_with_name_services.html[LDAP] on the storage system.

//Can steps 1-3 be accomplished in SM.Next? I’m not seeing any way to do so.
//I’m not sure how common this is in Kerberos deployments, but the Kerberos configuration and name mapping tasks are in different Settings sub-windows.

.Steps

. At the ONTAP command line, set UNIX permissions for the storage VM root volume.

.. Display the relevant permissions on the SVM root volume: `volume show -volume _root_vol_name_-fields user,group,unix-permissions`
The root volume of the SVM must have the following configuration:
[cols=2,options="header"]
|===
| Name... | Setting...
| UID | root or ID 0
| GID | root or ID 0
| UNIX permissions | 755
|===

.. If these values are not shown, use the `volume modify` command to update them.

. Set user permissions for the storage VM root volume.

.. Display the local UNIX users: `vserver services name-service unix-user show -vserver _vserver_name_`
The SVM must have the following UNIX users configured:
[cols=3,options="header"]
|===
| User name | User ID | Primary group ID
| nfs | 500 | 0
| root | 0 | 0
|===
*Note:* The nfs user is not required if a Kerberos-UNIX name mapping exists for the SPN of the NFS client user; see step 5.

.. If these values are not shown, use the `vserver services name-service unix-user modify` command to update them.

. Set group permissions for the storage VM root volume.

.. Display the local UNIX groups: `vserver services name-service unix-group show -vserver _vserver_name_`
The SVM must have the following UNIX groups configured:
[cols=2,options="header"]
|===
| Group name | Group ID
| daemon | 1
| root | 0
|===

.. If these values are not shown use the `vserver services name-service unix-group modify` command to update them.

. Switch to System Manager and configure Kerberos: click *Storage > Storage VMs*, select the storage VM, click *Settings*, click image:icon_arrow.gif[arrow] under Kerberos, click *Add* under Kerberos Realm, and complete the following sections:

.. Add Kerberos Realm: enter configuration details depending on KDC vendor.

.. Add Network Interface to Realm: click *Add* and select a LIF.

. If desired, add mappings from Kerberos principal names to local user names.

.. Click *Storage > Storage VMs*, select the storage VM, click *Settings*, and then click image:icon_arrow.gif[arrow] under Name Mapping.

.. Under Kerberos to UNIX, add patterns and replacements using regular expressions.
