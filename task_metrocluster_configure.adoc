Starting with ONTAP 9.8, you can manage MetroCluster site operations with System Manager.  After setting up two clusters and peering them, you configure each cluster.

.Before you start
You should have completed the following procedures:

* link:task_metrocluster_setup[Set up a MetroCluster site]

* link:task_metrocluster_peering[Set up MetroCluster peering]

== Configure the connection between clusters

.Steps

. Log in to System Manager on one of the clusters in the MetroCluster, and select *Dashboard*.
+
In the *MetroCluster* section, the graphic shows the two clusters that you set up and peered for the MetroCluster. The cluster you are working from (local cluster) is shown on the left.

. Click *Configure MetroCluster*.  From this window, you can perform the following tasks:

.. The nodes for each cluster in the MetroCluster are shown.  Use the drop-down lists to select which nodes in the local cluster will be disaster recovery partners with which nodes in the remote cluster.

.. Click the check box if you want to configure a mediator site. See <<Configure the mediator>>.

.. If both clusters have a license to enable encryption, the *Encryption* section is displayed.
To enable encryption, enter a passphrase.

. Click *Save* to configure the MetroCluster.
+
On the *Dashboard*, in the *MetroCluster* section, the graphic shows a check mark on the link between the two clusters, indicating a healthy connection.

== Configure the mediator

The mediator is typically installed at a geographic location separate from either location of the clusters. The clusters communicate regularly with the mediator to indicate that they are up and running.  If one of the clusters in the MetroCluster detects that the communication with its partner cluster is down, it checks with the mediator to determine if the partner cluster itself is down.

.Before you start

Both clusters in the MetroCluster should be up and peered.

.Steps

. In System Manager 9.8, select *Cluster > Settings*.

. In the *Mediator* section, click image:icon_gear.gif[Settings gear icon].

. On the *Configure Mediator* window, click image:icon_add.gif[Add icon].

. Enter the configuration details for the mediator.
