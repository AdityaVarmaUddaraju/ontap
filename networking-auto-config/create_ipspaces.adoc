You can use an IPspace to create a distinct IP address space for each SVM in a cluster. Doing so enables clients in administratively separate network domains to access cluster data while using overlapping IP addresses from the same IP address subnet range.

*Before you begin*

You must be a cluster administrator to perform this task.

*Step*

Create an IPspace.

`network ipspace create -ipspace ipspace1`

`network ipspace show`

....
IPspace             Vserver List          Broadcast Domains
------------------- --------------------- ----------------------------
Cluster             Cluster               Cluster
Default             Cluster1              Default
ipspace1            ipspace1              -
....

The IPspace is created, along with the system SVM for the IPspace. The system SVM carries management traffic.
