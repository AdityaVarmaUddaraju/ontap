== Do I need technical support to revert?

You can revert without assistance on new or test clusters.  You should call technical support if you experience any of the following:

* You are in a production environment and your upgrade fails or you encounter any problems before or after the upgrade such as:
** The upgrade process fails and cannot finish.
** The upgrade process finishes, but the cluster is unusable in a production environment.
** The upgrade process finishes and the cluster goes into production, but you are not satisfied with its behavior.
** The upgrade process finishes for some but not all of the nodes, and you decide that you want to revert.
* You created volumes in ONTAP 9.5 or later and you need to revert to an earlier version. Volumes using adaptive compression must be uncompressed before reverting.
