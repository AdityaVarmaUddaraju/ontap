After reverting to an earlier version of ONTAP, you must enable Snapshot copy policies to start creating Snapshot copies again.

You are reenabling the Snapshot schedules that you disabled before you reverted to an earlier version of ONTAP.

. Enable Snapshot copy policies for all data SVMs: `volume snapshot policy modify -vserver * -enabled true``snapshot policy modify pg-rop-hourly -enable true`
. For each node, enable the Snapshot copy policy of the root volume by using the run-nodenodenamevol optionsroot_vol_namenosnap off command.
