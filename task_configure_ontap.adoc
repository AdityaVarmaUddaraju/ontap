You can quickly create a cluster and configure ONTAP software for your cluster. System Manager provides a simple and easy workflow for setting up the cluster and configuring storage.

Your system should already be installed and cabled according to the http://docs.netapp.com/platstor/index.jsp[Installation and Setup Instructions^] that came with the system. Also, cluster network interfaces should be configured on each node of the cluster for intra-cluster communication.

== Assign a node-management IP address
=== Windows System
You should connect your Windows computer to the same subnet as the controllers. This will automatically assign a node-management IP address to your system.

.Step
. From the Windows system, open the *Network* drive to discover the nodes.
. Double-click the node to launch the cluster setup wizard.

=== Other systems
You should configure the node-management IP address for one of the nodes in your cluster. You can use this node-management IP address to launch the cluster set up wizard.

See link:https://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.netapp.doc.dot-cm-ssg%2FGUID-6A814DD5-602C-4398-8742-41657A99785F.html[Creating the cluster on the first node] for information about assigning a node-management IP address.

== Initialize the cluster
You initialize the cluster by setting an administrative password for the cluster and setting up the cluster management and node management networks. You can also configure services like a DNS server to resolve host names and an NTP server to synchronize time.

.Steps
. On a web browser, enter the node-management IP address that you have configured: "https://node-management-IP"
+
System Manager automatically discovers the remaining nodes in the cluster.
. Initialize the storage system by configuring the cluster management network and node management IP addresses for all the nodes.

== Create your local tier
Create local tiers from the available disks or SSDs in your nodes. System Manager automatically calculates the best tier configuration based on your hardware.

.Steps
. Click *Dashboard* and then click *Prepare Storage*.
+
Accept the storage recommendation for your local tier.

== Configure protocols
Depending on the licenses enabled on your cluster, you can enable the desired protocols on your cluster.  You then create network interfaces using which you can access the storage.

.Steps
. Click *Dashboard* and then click *Configure Protocols*.
* Enable iSCSI or FC for SAN access.
* Enable NFS or SMB/CIFS for NAS access.
* Enable NVMe for FC-NVMe access.

== Provision Storage
You can now provision storage. The options you see depends on the licenses that are installed.

.Steps
. Click *Dashboard* and then click *Provision Storage*.
* To link:concept_san_provision_overview.html[provision SAN access], click *Add LUNs*.
* To link:concept_nas_provision_overview.html[provision NAS access], click *Add Volumes*.
* To link:concept_nvme_provision_overview.html[provision NVMe storage], click *Add Namespaces*.
