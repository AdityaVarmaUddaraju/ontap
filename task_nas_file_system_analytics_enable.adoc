To collect and display usage data, you must enable File System Analytics. You can do so using System Manager, the ONTAP CLI, or REST APIs.

You can enable File System Analytics when you create a new volume, or when you upgrade a system with volumes to ONTAP 9.8 or later. After upgrading, be sure that all upgrade processes have completed before enabling analytics. Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, you can also view the most active files, directories, clients, and users for a selected FlexGroup or FlexVol volume with the Activity Tracking feature. 

Depending on the size and contents of the volume, enabling analytics might take some time while ONTAP processes existing data in the volume. System Manager displays progress and presents analytics data when complete. If you need more precise information about initialization progress, you can use the ONTAP CLI command `volume analytics show`.

.Procedure to enable File System Analytics
. Click *Storage > Volumes*, then select the desired volume.
. Click *Explorer*, then click *Enable Analytics* or *Disable Analytics*.
