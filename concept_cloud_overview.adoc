You can use FabricPool to automatically tier data depending on how frequently the data is accessed.

FabricPool is a hybrid storage solution that uses an all flash (all SSD) aggregate as the performance tier and an object store as the cloud tier. Data in a FabricPool is stored in a tier based on whether it is frequently accessed or not. Using a FabricPool helps you reduce storage cost without compromising performance, efficiency, or protection.
