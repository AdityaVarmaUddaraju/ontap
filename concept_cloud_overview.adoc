You can use FabricPool to move data automatically between performance and cloud tiers depending on how frequently the data is accessed.

FabricPool is a hybrid storage solution that uses an all flash (all SSD) aggregate as the performance tier and an object store as the cloud tier. Using a FabricPool helps you reduce storage cost without compromising performance, efficiency, or protection.

The cloud tier can be located on NetApp StorageGRID, or one of the following service providers:

* Alibaba cloud

* Amazon S3

* Google Cloud

* IBM cloud

* Microsoft Azure Blob Storage
