Create LUNs to provide storage for an ESXi host using the FC or iSCSI SAN protocol. LUNs appear as disks to the ESXi host.

. For FC, zone your FC switches by WWPN. Use one zone per initiator and include all target ports in each zone.

. Use Virtual Storage Console (VSC) for VMware vSphere, to discover and initialize the LUN and to verify that the ESXi hosts can write and read data on the LUN.
