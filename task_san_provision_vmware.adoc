Create LUNs to provide storage for an ESXi host using the FC or iSCSI SAN protocol. LUNs appear as disks to the ESXi host.

This procedure creates new LUNs on an existing storage VM. Your FC or iSCSI protocol should already be set up.

NOTE: Beginning in ONTAP 9.8, when you provision storage, QoS is enabled by default. You can disable QoS or choose a custom QoS policy during the provisioning process or at a later time.

.Steps

. In ONTAP System Manager, click *Storage > LUNs* and then click Add.
+
If you need to create a new initiator group, click *More Options*.
+
If you are running ONTAP 9.8 or later, and you want to disable QoS or choose a custom QoS policy click *More Options* and then select *Performance Service Level*.

. For FC, zone your FC switches by WWPN. Use one zone per initiator and include all target ports in each zone.

. Use Virtual Storage Console (VSC) for VMware vSphere, to discover and initialize the LUN and to verify that the ESXi hosts can write and read data on the LUN.
