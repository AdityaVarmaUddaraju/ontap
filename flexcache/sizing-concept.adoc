You must be aware of the limits for FlexCache volumes before you start provisioning the volumes.

The size limit of a FlexVol volume is applicable to an origin volume. The size of a FlexCache volume can be less than or equal to the origin volume. The best practice for the size of a FlexCache volume is to be at least 10 percent of the size of the origin volume.
