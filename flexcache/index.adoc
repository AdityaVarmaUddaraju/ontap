This content describes how to configure and manage FlexCache volumes for accelerating data access.

You should use this content if you want to configure FlexCache volumes in the following way:

* You are running ONTAP 9.5 or later.
* You want to use the ONTAP command-line interface (CLI), not ONTAP System Manager or an automated scripting tool.
* You want to use best practices, not explore every available option.
+
Details about command syntax are available from the CLI help and the ONTAP man pages.

* You do not want to read a lot of conceptual background.
* You have cluster administrator privileges, not SVM administrator privileges.

Starting with ONTAP 9.6, you can use ONTAP System Manager for creating and managing FlexCache volumes.
