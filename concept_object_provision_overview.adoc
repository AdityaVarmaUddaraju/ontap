Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, you can enable an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) object storage server in an ONTAP cluster.

System Manager supports two on-premises use case scenarios for serving S3 object storage:

*	FabricPool tier to a bucket on local cluster (self-tiering) or remote cluster (cloud tier).
*	S3 client app access to a bucket on the local cluster or a remote cluster.

For more information about tiering, see <link to FabricPool topics>.

NOTE: ONTAP 3 is appropriate if you want S3 capabilities on existing clusters without additional hardware and management. For larger deployments, NetApp StorageGRID software continues to be the NetApp flagship solution for object storage. For more information, see <link to SG docs>.

When you create an S3 bucket using System Manager, ONTAP configures a default performance service level that is the highest available on your system. For example, on an AFF system, the default setting would be *Extreme*. You can also select a non-default value:

*	*Extreme*: Used for applications that expect the lowest latency and highest performance.
*	*Performance*: Used for applications with modest performance needs and latency.
*	*Value*: Used for applications for which throughput and capacity are more important than latency.
*	*Custom*: Specify a custom QoS policy or no QoS policy. See also <Qos link>

If you check the box *Use for tiering*, no performance service levels are selected, and the system tries to select low-cost media with optimal performance for the tiered data.

System Manager tries to assign the most appropriate disks in its local tiers for these service levels. However, if you need to specify which disks to include in the local tier (aggregate), consider configuring S3 object storage with the CLI. If you configure the S3 server with the CLI, you can still manage it with System Manager if desired. For more information, see <link>.
