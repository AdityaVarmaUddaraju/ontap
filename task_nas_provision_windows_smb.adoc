Create volumes to provide storage for Windows servers using the SMB/CIFS protocol.

This procedure creates new volumes on an link:task_nas_enable_windows_smb.html[existing SMB-enabled storage VM].

//add link above when file is created

NOTE: Beginning in ONTAP 9.8, when you provision storage, QoS is enabled by default. You can disable QoS or choose a custom QoS policy during the provisioning process or at a later time.

.Steps

. Create a new volume: click *Storage > Volumes* and then click *Add*.
+
The default share grants full access to all users. You can modify the Access Control List (ACL) later.
+
If you are running ONTAP 9.8 or later, and you want to disable QoS or choose a custom QoS policy click *More Options* and then select *Performance Service Level*.

. Switch to a Windows client to verify that the share is accessible.

.. In Windows Explorer, map a drive to the share in the following format: `+\\_SMB_Server_Name__Share_Name_+`

.. On the newly created drive, create a test file, write text to it, and then delete the file.

After verifying access, you might want to link:task_nas_provision_export_policies.html[restrict client access with the share ACL] and set any desired security properties on the mapped drive.
