If you have accidently deleted one or more FlexVol volumes, you can now recover these volumes. You can also delete the volumes permanently by purging the volumes.

Steps
1. Click *Storage > Volumes*.
2. Click *More> Show Deleted Volumes*.
3. Select the volumes and click the desired action.

Deleting a volume deletes the associated configurations of the volume. Recovering a volume does not reset all the configurations. You should perform the following tasks manually after recovering a volume to bring the volume back to its original state:
Steps
1.	Rename the volume
2.	Set up a junction path
3.	Create mappings for LUNs in the volume
4.	Associate a Snapshot policy and export policy with the volume
5.	Add new quota policy rules for the volume
6.	Add a QOS policy for the volume
