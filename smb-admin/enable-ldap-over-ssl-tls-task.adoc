[.lead]
Before your CIFS server can use TLS for secure communication with an Active Directory LDAP server, you must modify the CIFS server security settings to enable LDAP over TLS.

.Steps

. Configure the CIFS server security setting that allows secure LDAP communication with Active Directory LDAP servers: `vserver cifs security modify -vserver vserver_name -use-start-tls-for-ad-ldap true`
. Verify that the LDAP over TLS security setting is set to `true`: `vserver cifs security show -vserver vserver_name`
+
[NOTE]
====
If the SVM uses the same LDAP server for querying name-mapping or other UNIX information (such as users, groups, and netgroups), then you must also modify the `-use-start-tls` option by using the `vserver services name-service ldap client modify` command.
