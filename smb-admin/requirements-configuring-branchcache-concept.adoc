After meeting some prerequisites, you can set up BranchCache.

The following requirements must be met before configuring BranchCache on the CIFS server for your SVM:

* ONTAP must be installed on all nodes in the cluster.
* CIFS must be licensed and a CIFS server must be configured.
* IPv4 or IPv6 network connectivity must be configured.
* For BranchCache 1, SMB 2.1 or later must be enabled.
* For BranchCache 2, SMB 3.0 must be enabled and the remote Windows clients must support BranchCache 2.
