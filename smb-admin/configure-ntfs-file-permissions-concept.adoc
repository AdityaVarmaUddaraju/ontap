You can configure NTFS file permissions on files and directories using the ONTAP CLI. This enables you to configure NTFS file permissions without needing to connect to the data using an SMB share on a Windows Client.

You can configure NTFS file permissions by adding entries to NTFS discretionary access control lists (DACLs) that are associated with an NTFS security descriptor. The security descriptor is then applied to NTFS files and directories.

You can only configure NTFS file permissions using the command line. You cannot configure NFSv4 ACLs by using the CLI.
