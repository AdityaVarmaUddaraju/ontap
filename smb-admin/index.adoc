This content describes ONTAP file access features available for the SMB protocol. It shows you how to enable a CIFS server, create shares, and enable Microsoft services. It includes planning guidance and detailed implementation instructions.

[NOTE]
====
_SMB_ (Server Message Block) refers to modern dialects of the Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol. You will still see _CIFS_ in the ONTAP command-line interface (CLI) and in OnCommand management tools.
====

*You should use this content* under the following circumstances:

* You want to understand the range of ONTAP SMB protocol capabilities.
* You want to perform less common configuration and maintenance tasks, not basic SMB/CIFS configuration.
* You want to use the command-line interface (CLI), not ONTAP System Manager or an automated scripting tool.

*If you want to create a basic configuration using best practices*, you should choose among the following documentation:

* link:../smb-config/index.html[SMB configuration with the CLI]
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-sm-classic/smb-config/index.html[SMB configuration with System Manager]
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-sm-classic/nas-multiprotocol-config/index.html[SMB and NFS multiprotocol configuration with System Manager]

*If you require additional configuration or conceptual information*, you should choose among the following documentation:

* Conceptual background for SMB/CIFS features

* Network and LIF management

* Hyper-V and SQL Server configuration and management over the SMB protocol
