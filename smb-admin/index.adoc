This content describes ONTAP file access features available for the SMB protocol. It shows you how to enable a CIFS server, create shares, and enable Microsoft services. It includes planning guidance and detailed implementation instructions.

[NOTE]
====
_SMB_ (Server Message Block) refers to modern dialects of the Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol. You will still see _CIFS_ in the ONTAP command-line interface (CLI) and in OnCommand management tools.
====

You should use this content under the following circumstances:

* You want to understand the range of ONTAP SMB protocol capabilities.
* You want to perform less common configuration and maintenance tasks, not basic SMB/CIFS configuration.
* You want to use the command-line interface (CLI), not ONTAP System Manager or an automated scripting tool.
