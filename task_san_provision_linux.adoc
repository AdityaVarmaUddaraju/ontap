Create LUNs to provide storage for a Linux server using the FC or iSCSI SAN protocol. LUNs appear to Linux as SCSI disk devices.

This procedure creates new LUNs on an existing storage VM. Your FC or iSCSI protocol should already be set up. You need to know the initiator identifiers (FC WWPN or iSCSI iqn) for your Linux server.

.Steps

. On your Linux server, install the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/download/software/sanhost_linux/Linux/[NetApp Linux Host Utilities] package.

. In ONTAP System Manager, click *Storage > LUNs* and then click *Add*.
+
If you need to create a new initiator group, click *More Options*.

. For FC, zone your FC switches by WWPN. Use one zone per initiator and include all target ports in each zone.

. On your Linux server, discover the new LUNs:
+
`/usr/bin/rescan-scsi-bus.sh`

. Optionally partition the LUNs and create file systems.

. Verify the Linux server can write and read data on the LUN.
